# Welcome to the PIE Cookbook

We’d love to have you join us in building the **PIE Cookbook**, an open source guide designed to help anyone, anywhere build the startup accelerator of their dreams. Why are we doing this? Because we believe that each and every community — with the right tools — has the potential to assist and accelerate its most promising folks further and faster toward success. 

And that’s good for everyone.

By joining this project, you’ll gain access to everything we’ve learned from nearly a decade of accelerating startups, building relationships that strengthen community, and facilitating creative output. What’s more — since this is an open source project — you’ll have the opportunity take part in creating the most effective documentation for building, managing, and running a successful startup accelerator for your community — whatever that community may be.

We are currently running a Kickstarter campaign to help us attract folks interested in this project. If what we're proposing sounds interesting to you, please head over to Kickstarter to learn more.
