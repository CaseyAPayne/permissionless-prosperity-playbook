# Welcome to the PIE Cookbook

We’d love to have you join us in building the **PIE Cookbook**, an open source guide designed to help anyone, anywhere build the startup accelerator of their dreams. Why are we doing this? Because we believe that each and every community — with the right tools — has the potential to assist and accelerate its most promising folks further and faster toward success. 

And that’s good for everyone.

By joining this project, you’ll gain access to everything we’ve learned from nearly a decade of accelerating startups, building relationships that strengthen community, and facilitating creative output. What’s more — since this is an open source project — you’ll have the opportunity take part in creating the most effective documentation for building, managing, and running a successful startup accelerator for your community — whatever that community may be.

## Kickstarter

We are currently running a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/turoczy/pie-cookbook-an-open-source-guide-for-startup-acce) to help us attract folks who are interested in contributing to this project. If what we're proposing sounds interesting to you, please [head over to Kickstarter to learn more](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/turoczy/pie-cookbook-an-open-source-guide-for-startup-acce ). 

## Structure

The PIE Cookbook repository is divided into the following directories:

- [/docs](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/tree/master/docs) — Home of the master PIE Cookbook document, which feeds Read the Docs
- [/drafts](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/tree/master/drafts/) — Written content that has not yet been added to the master PIE Cookbook document
- [/notes](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/tree/master/notes/) — Notes about the project, topics to be written, feedback from participants, distillation of source materials, and parking lot items
- [/source](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/tree/master/source/) — Relevant URLs, documents, and source materials that inform the content of the PIE Cookbook

## Feedback

We are looking forward to building this content with you. To participate, we recommend using the [PIE Cookbook Issues](https://github.com/piepdx/pie-cookbook/issues) to comment on the content under development and track the ongoing development.
