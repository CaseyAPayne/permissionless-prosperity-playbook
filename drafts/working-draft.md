# PIE Cookbook

## Preface 
> It's hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the time. I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because we ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the very beginning. But as the summer progressed we were increasingly impressed by how well the startups were doing.… When people came to YC to speak at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone coming to address a Boy Scout troop. By the time they left the building they were all saying some variant of "Wow, these companies might actually succeed."

> - Paul Graham, [How Y Combinator Started](http://old.ycombinator.com/start.html)

This cookbook all began simply enough. As a way of formalizing the mechanics and processes of the PIE program. In case one of us, as the euphemism goes, got hit by a bus.

But once we started working on it. And building it out. We realized that we were actually beginning to scratch the surface of something much larger. Something far more compelling. 

What we had hit upon — unbeknownst to us at the time — was a framework for anyone, anywhere to start building a startup accelerator. 

Or, perhaps even more generically, a way for people to accelerate creative output. 

As with framework, we were curious as to whether what we had built would have value for others. Was it repeatable? Where were our blind spots? Could others improve upon our initial learnings? Suffice it to say, we had tons of questions. 

So drawing on our Portland open source roots, we began to think of this as something bigger than PIE. And what better way to enable folks from all communities to join us in taking on that challenge than to open source the document? An open invitation for others to provide feedback and insights for the greater good. And a starting point — a baseline — from which we could continue to iterate, test, and revise much as we would with any startup. Or experiment. 

Because the best thing about experiments is that whether you succeed or fail you always, always, always learn something.

Welcome to the PIE Cookbook.

### Caveats

I have always been a fan of books that start with a caveat or two. Because inevitably, you, gentle reader, have just started down this path. And given that you've already started to get a feel for where this is going, you're inevitably jumping to the question: Is this book for me?

The answer is yes. But with a few caveats.

#### 1. This is not a problem technology can solve. 

If technology could solve this problem, we would have built it. Trust us. But it can't. This isn't about algorithms or dynamically connecting dots. This is about getting to know people. And what makes them tick. And what pisses them off. And what scares them. This is about seeing non-obvious connections. It is about using what artists refer to as "negative space." Finding opportunity in what is absent or invisible.   
  
> Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.  
  
> The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The Japanese word "ma" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in garden design.  
  
> - ["Negative space" in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space)  
  
So if you're looking for a way to throw technology at the problem and avoid the messy feels and stuff, it's probably best to stop reading here and starting searching the web for what you think you need.

![All the feels](/source/images/all-the-feels.jpg "All the feels")
 
#### 2. This is not a scalable solution. 

This is the very reason we're not seeking to stamp out a ton of cookie cutter versions of PIE. Because our way of doing this doesn't scale. Well, that and "cookie cutter" and "PIE" is a mixed metaphor. We don't believe you can recreate what we created to solve Portland, Oregon's technology startup problem late in the first decade of this century. Nor would we want you to.     
  
It's not that we haven't tried. We have. But each time, it comes out differently. Because the community the each accelerator model supports needs it to be different. 

Again, if your hope is to find some easily repeatable way of doing this, the way is shut. It was made by those who are communities. And the communities keep it. The way is shut. 

![The way is shut](/source/images/way-is-shut.gif "The way is shut")

#### 3. This is not an efficient solution. 

Given the first two caveats, it is appropriate to assume the third — and potentially most obvious — caveat, that one of how time consuming this is. It doesn't scale. There are no technology shortcuts. It takes time. But none of it is wasted. Even if you're making mistakes. Because it is through that process of trying, iterating, changing, and learning that you will manage to build the best accelerator for your community — no matter what that community happens to be.

### Format

We’ve structured this as a cookbook for an accelerator. And admittedly, we may have been a little heavy handed with that whole analogy. Sorry. That’s just how we roll. But you’ll get used to it. 

At least, we’re not subjecting you to the endless stream of idiotic pie related puns we bandy about on a daily basis. So be thankful for that. 

Besides, it seemed to be a really compelling way to get you from the first taste of an accelerator to, well, dessert. 

And honestly, when it comes right down to it? You’ll quickly realize that every founder has the exact same personality traits as a temperamental chef. Obsessed with perfection. Driven to succeed. Shouldering the brunt of every criticism no matter how seemingly minute.

And loving what they do. Not matter how hard and painful it is to foster the creation of something amazing.  

One of the most important headings you’ll find throughout the cookbook will be labeled “Mistakes were made.” This is where PIE screwed up, tripped, or outright failed. Why is this critical? Because you can follow the recipe word for word and never accurately recreate PIE. But you can always learn from our mistakes.

You’ll also see sections labeled “Happy accidents.” These are times where we tried something random or accidentally discovered a benefit through absolutely no planning whatsoever. It just sort of happened. Salt fell in the pot and it just tasted better. And it helped. And hopefully it will help you. And inspire you to take random risks of your own.

Finally, we’ll do our best to share all of the ingredients, preparations, step-by-step instructions, and intended results of these recipes. And if we don’t do that terribly well? Tell us. And we’ll fix it. For everyone. 

Note: Your flavors of PIE will vary. In fact, they must vary. If they don’t, you’re likely doing it wrong.

### Building a studio

When it comes right down to it, all we’ve done at PIE is figure out a way to create a protected and trusted environment for creative people to try new things — and potentially fail. It’s like any artist’s studio. 

### PIE as an example

> My hope is that you do not view the use of Boulder here as "Boulder tooting its own horn." I use Boulder as an example of a lasting and vibrant startup community because I know it extremely well (at least one segment). This approach is called synecdoche, where the part stands for the whole. There are many things the Boulder startup community can do better and many more for it to discovers we continue on our journey; my hope is that by exploring it in depth it helps you with your journey in your startup community.

> - Brad Feld in Startup Communities

Throughout this book, you’ll find us using PIE as an example. I mean, I guess it makes sense. It’s the accelerator we know best. But please keep in mind that references to PIE are meant to serve as that and only that. An example. 

It’s not doctrine. Or a specific recipe. Or maybe even the right way to do things. In fact, we’ll highlight—on any number of occasions—how it was absolutely not the right way to do things.

Please don’t think that we’re purporting to have the only recipe for an accelerator. Because we don’t. And if that’s what you’re hoping to get out of this book, then you should probably stop reading right now.

Because there are plenty of ways for you to start an accelerator based solely on someone else’s model. And there are any number of successful accelerators that have programs to help you do this. There are also any number of curricula available for purchase that will arm you to deliver their prescribed way of learning.

And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with taking those paths to an accelerator. For many, that is the only viable way of effectively achieving the goals they are trying to meet. 

But that’s not what this book is designed to do. Far from it.

What this book is designed to do is quite simple. We’re going to teach you to fish.

We simply wanted to provide some contextual evidence for our learnings at PIE, the majority of which will be purely anecdotal. This is a conceit to bring our theoretical guidance into more tactical applications. And to prove to you that we screwed up a lot, made a ton of mistakes, and got lucky in any number of ways. 

And it’s important to note that we have realized these concepts not only in the context of early stage technology startups. Yes, we’ve spent the majority of our time and learning applying these techniques to early stage tech startups. But we’ve also experimented with these techniques on nonprofits, open source projects, and solo founders. We’ve applied these techniques to more traditional creative pursuits. We’ve even had opportunities to test these processes on internal employee teams as a means of driving innovation throughout large corporations. 

Long story short, there are any number of ways to apply the concepts of trust, pressure, and mentorship to any number of creative pursuits. To accelerate creative output. 

But our context for this experimentation has always been PIE. And in order for PIE to make sense as a point of reference, you need to understand a little bit of the history of the organization. And also recognize that, much like you, we started by simply taking what others were doing, using that as a framework for something different, and iterating from there. 

While we’ll get into specific elements of the program, its composition, and its multiple iterations throughout the book, here is some grounding in where this whole thing started.


## No interest in building a startup accelerator like PIE? Good. 
[Source](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/no-interest-in-building-a-startup-accelerator-like-pie-good-f31ecbd14e05 "Permalink to No interest in building a startup accelerator like PIE? Good. — Portland Incubator Experiment — Medium")

### Our motivation to[ share the _PIE Cookbook_][10] isn't to convince you to recreate[ PIE][11]. It's to inspire you to create something new — and better.

I was having a conversation with a friend, recently. Given that we're both startup types, the topic of conversation eventually gravitated to the [_PIE Cookbook_][10] project.

His response? An unadulterated "**Meh.**"

I paused.

I mean, he's a serial entrepreneur. He's been mentored. He's been a mentor. He's seen a bunch of startups. He's currently working for a startup — _that went through an accelerator_.

Why wasn't this concept super interesting to him?

The reason — it didn't take me long to realize — is because **the thought of starting some also-ran tech startup accelerator isn't terribly interesting to _most_ people these days**.

And then it dawned on me. The idea of convincing others to build some preconceived, generic tech accelerator hosting a hodgepodge of startups, in this day and age, **wasn't even a concept that motivated or interested me**.

Furthermore, it occurred to me as we continued the conversation that we, as PIE, had just assumed — or taken for granted — that our true motivations for creating the _PIE Cookbook_ were obvious. And that our hopes for this next phase of the ongoing experiment were clear.

**They're not.**

So let's be clear. **Inspiring the creation of a bunch of generic startup accelerators is not — at all — how we hope people will use the _PIE Cookbook_.** Trust us.

But at first blush, I realize that's _exactly_ what it looks like we were trying to do. And with this new vantage, I recognize how our prevailing assumptions, today's startup rat race, and our lack of clarity may lead to a very flawed first impression of the _PIE Cookbook_.

That's our fault. So I'd like to ask you to **please take a moment to look deeper.**

### PIE is actually an experiment in accelerating creativity

When[ Renny][12] reached out to me to start the conversation that would eventually become PIE, he had one very clear hypothesis he was interested in testing:

> Entrepreneurs and technologists are a new creative class, and their problem-solving toolkit will be increasingly important to solve the emerging brand challenges we tackle at Wieden+Kennedy. But words and images don't always seem to play well with code. And folks great at one craft may not recognize another as "creative." But in a world of distributed software and hardware, it's important to find ways to work together. Entrepreneurs and technologists are inspired creatives who've chosen technology as their medium for creative expression. We should be able to find ways to do cool stuff, together.

And that hypothesis has remained a guiding principle for PIE for nearly a decade. First as a coworking space then as a startup accelerator then as a means of effecting more compelling collaborations between corporations and startups. But through and through, we've always been about **creating innovation communities** and **accelerating creative output**.

The _PIE Cookbook_ is no different.

### It's your job to improve upon the recipe

With that in mind, **please don't try to recreate PIE**. In fact, we would hate for you to bake our flavor of PIE. This isn't a sleeve of prepared cookie dough that you halfheartedly slice onto a cookie sheet. This is a "Bake your own" proposition. This is a recipe. And everyone has their own unique ingredients.

This is about rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands in the mix. Making the recipe yours. Experimenting, manipulating, iterating, exploring, and improving.

**The world needs more variety — not less.** And together, we all get better.

Therefore, we'd like to ask: How might the PIE recipe be adapted to meet your community's needs?

Maybe you could…

* Use the PIE recipe to create an environment that focuses on companies engaged in services-based businesses — read "not candidates for equity investment." Maybe you could create ways to better meet their unique business needs? And maybe you could create entirely new ways of investing in and evaluating these companies? You could. Because that's exactly what[ **Oregon Story Board**][13] is doing with the PIE recipe, as it accelerates companies in the world of digital storytelling. All of which enabled them to be among Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, UC Berkeley, and Virginia Tech as an[ early stage grantee for Microsoft HoloLens][14].
* Leverage the PIE model to focus on issues that are adversely impacting your community. Like lack of inclusion. And ineffective support for women founders. Maybe you could use it to raise the visibility of a whole ton of awesome founders from communities of color? Maybe this effort could be part of a broader economic plan to make your entire community a better place to live? You could. Because that's how the [Portland Development Commission][15] is adapting the PIE recipe to guide and accelerate companies in the[ **Startup PDX Challenge**][16].
* Identify the compelling knowledge and resources your community has accumulated. And look for ways to activate that knowledge by using an a PIE-flavored accelerator to focus that energy. That expertise could be geographical. It could be cultural. It could be the business environment, itself. You could. Because that's exactly what the town of Newberg, Oregon — the gateway to the Willamette Valley wine country — is doing with the[ **Newberg Innovation Accelerator**][17], a project that will focus efforts on agricultural technology projects and businesses that directly impact the wine industry.
* Use the PIE recipe as means of changing the way employees approach, attack, and resolve problems _within_ a corporation. You could bring a cross-functional team of folks from throughout the company to a shared communal workspace that resembles an accelerator. To work for three months on an entrenched problem, free from the typical approval cycles and sacred cows of corporate life. To get them out of the building and get them engaged with real customers. To hear, firsthand, how they can fix things. You could. Because that's exactly what[ **Daimler**][18]** did with their SPIN program**, by using the PIE recipe to create an internal accelerator. For employees.
* Or maybe you could **come up with something completely unique**. Maybe you could use the PIE recipe to build new curricula at a college. Or to create a nonprofit accelerator. Or to change the dynamic of an R&amp;D shop. Or to rethink craft brewing. Or to create agencies. Or to help Kickstarter projects survive, post funding. Or to change the world of VR. Or to help bloggers build better business models. Or to give artists an environment to create. Or to help a diverse slice of indie game developers change the face of gaming. Or to build a maker space. Or to help lifestyle companies succeed more efficiently. Or or or or…

The point is that the _PIE Cookbook_ is designed **to inspire you to do something**. To help you frame up your organization, your community, and yourself. To give you a pattern for what success might look like. And how to budget for chaos, random constructive collisions, and innovation. **To get creative. Not repetitive.**

The _PIE Cookbook_ is designed to help provide a framework and some confidence. To give you courage. [To provide suggestions][19] and inspiration. It's designed to help you understand — or to educate your superiors — that it's actually okay to try this stuff. To show them it's not just _acceptable_ to participate, but it's exciting and critical to survival as well. **The _PIE Cookbook_ is our way of telling you to step off that cliff and go for it.**

Not interested in building a generic tech startup accelerator? Good. Please don't. [Go do something more interesting than that][10].

And, by all means, please keep us in the loop. We're looking forward to learning from — and with — you.

It seems a lot of folks want to build an accelerator to somehow create a startup community from scratch. Unfortunately, that's not really how this thing works. 

An accelerator can attract a community. An accelerator can codify a community. An accelerator can even import a community. But an accelerator has to have a community. 

Building an accelerator is not a means of creating a community from scratch. Building an accelerator is a means of accelerating or capitalizing on the momentum of an existing community, identifying and enabling community leaders, and providing infrastructure for supporters and contributors to engage, thereby enabling all parties, throughout the community, to focus everyone's efforts to the greatest benefit — and highest likelihood of success — for that community.

The best accelerators spring up from communities. Great communities can form around accelerators, but they need a seed community from which to spring.

If you don't have an existing community, keep this in mind when you're deciding on the focus of your accelerator. Because if you don't have a community then your accelerator needs to be attractive enough to recruit a community around it.

## Current state of accelerators 

While PIE will speak from its vantage point on its experience as coworking space, a community hub, and an early stage tech startup accelerator, the PIE Cookbook is not meant to be tech specific. Nor is it meant to be a guide that only applies to startups.
 
We believe that the accelerator model is a powerful and efficient educational construct to can be applied to a variety of markets, businesses, and communities. 

We believe that no one has perfected it yet. So you should feel free to adapt and revise it as you see fit. 

We believe that the accelerator market is currently like the search engine market pre-Google. There are lots of well meaning people sort of doing things right but no one has really hit upon a repeatable and successful formula for doing this.

Remember pre-Google Web? Well if you don’t, suffice it to say that there were a few choices for searching the Web, back in the day. Like hundreds. And no single one had significant traction. Mostly because they were all variations on a theme. Some were directories. Some were aggregators. Some were really, really smart algorithms. Many of them were wildly successful at the time. But none of them had really nailed the way to find the most relevant information on the Web. That’s kind of where we are with accelerators, today. And I’m hopeful that getting more smart people thinking about the model will help us find a better way of doing this. For everyone. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p

Using higher education as an analogy, accelerators have our Harvard and Stanford. We have our Oxford. But where our state schools? Our small private liberal arts colleges? Where are our vocational schools and community colleges? We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface for this educational model.

As far as accelerators go, we have our Ivy Leagues and our Stanford, but we have barely begun to scratch the surface for this educational model. Where is the Georgia Tech of accelerators? Where is the RISD? Where is the Reed or Whitman? Better yet, where is the state school or community college or junior college? Where is the vocational school of accelerators? There’s still plenty of room to explore this educational model. We have a long way to go before we’ve even leveraged the existing model, let alone begun to inflate the bubble. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p

## Spoiler alert

This document is full of "spoiler alerts," things that PIE has learned over the course of time. In most every case, it may not be wise — or downright foolhardy — to start where PIE ended. You should start where PIE started. And try to end where you want to end. 

There is inherent value in the journey, itself.

Attempting to start an accelerator without an existing community is a recipe, too. It’s a recipe for disaster. 

Accelerators don't start communities. Communities start accelerators.

Your accelerator should be a reflection of your community — or the community you want to attract. 

In other words, don't try to build an accelerator that doesn't have a target community. 

For PIE, that target community was the startup community that was beginning to form in Portland. It was the combination of the open source community, a nascent group of early stage companies who were seeking assistance and capital, and a group of experienced startup folks who were looking for a means of giving back to the community. Folks who were willing to share their expertise if only there were a means of doing that.

- It's a means of catalyzing existing community
- Be honest about your community
- You can only work with what you've got
- You have to start with the ingredients your community has, but you don't need to follow the existing community momentum
- You're allowed to bring different ingredients into the community, but the initial activity must start with existing assets
- Some of your community assets may have never combined before (e.g., Portland startup community and W+K), but they're still both assets to be considered

It is incredibly difficult to do virtual communities well. Not loosely affiliated social networks. Clearly folks have managed to do that. But communities. Actual interacting and collaborating communities. Groups of people who share common interests, work toward common goals, and support one another. 

In our experience, this kind of activity does not happen out in the ether. It happens somewhere. Physically and personally. Community, we believe, needs a place. 

And this has come into sharp relief as we've moved away from PIE being a physical presence. We've learned that not having a physical space has actually weakened our ability to scale and the strength of our connections. The more we rely on virtual, the more it makes it difficult to accomplish the things our community needs. 

Long story short, we greatly underestimated the positive impact and community benefits of having an actual physical place. That's why we're working to correct that. To return to PIE being less virtual and more physical. Because our community needs that physical space.

					11. Entrepreneurs and technologists are a new creative class, and their problem-solving toolkit will be increasingly important to solve the emerging brand challenges we tackle at Wieden+Kennedy. But words and images don’t always seem to play well with code. And folks great at one craft may not recognize another as “creative.” But in a world of distributed software and hardware, it’s important to find ways to work together. Entrepreneurs and technologists are inspired creatives who’ve chosen technology as their medium for creative expression. We should be able to find ways to do cool stuff, together.

		7. Experiments
			8. PIE's culture of experimentation
			9. PIE's culture of community
				10. (via @nohorse) "One of the things I always appreciated about PIE was that it felt like it embodies the spirit of collaboration in Portland. For example PIE seems at home in Centrl Office. It's likely something that is obvious to folks who have spent a while in Portland or Austin, but it's slow to sink in to some cities. There is a value in supporting other business incubators, maker spaces, coworking spaces, in your city and build a web of trust where everyone can feel safe and supported. Competition in the classic capitalistic sense is toxic to the young businesses that need as much help and support as they can to get off the ground and should never need to feel like they are picking brands or picking sides and potentially burning bridges to get the help they need. It might seem obvious to the cookbook authors, but it's worth explaining as it's a new concept to many folks."
			8. Coworking
				9. 2009-2011
				10. In 2009, PIE served as a curated coworking space for promising early stage startups and interesting creatives who called Portland home. During the coworking phase, PIE served as a hub for community, regularly hosting gatherings, hackathons, and educational meet ups.

		17. Patron(s)
			18. At PIE, we get a lot of questions about how to fund accelerator operations and investments. It makes sense. Finding the money that matches up with the opportunity is a challenge. It’s never easy. No matter how compelling the pitch. 
			18. What are the objectives?
			19. What is the expertise?
			20. How can they help?
			21. Can take several flavors (Note: This isn’t an exhaustive list. But it’s gives you a pretty good idea of where to look.)
				22. In our observations, there are four types of folks who fund accelerators. Sometimes they’re actual, well, folks. Sometimes they’re companies. Sometimes they’re angels or venture capitalists. But here are the buckets into which they seem to fall.
				22. True patron
				23. Sponsor
				24. Partner
				25. Investor
					26. On the upside, venture capital can be a very effective means of funding this sort of activity. 
						27. Used to spending money on risky efforts
						28. Have a time horizon that is in line with company maturation
						29. Have the potential to provide follow on investment.
						30. Ongoing portfolio management can be super valuable for the continued success of your companies.
					27. On the downside, this funding mechanism can curtail the experimental nature of an accelerator if VC is the only backing. 
						28. VCs are in the business of making money. 
						29. The relationship will be driven by financial motivations. 
						30. Will likely be only interested in investing in
							31. Companies that have the highest likelihood of returning capital to the fund 
							32. Companies that best match their investment thesis.
						33. This sort of focus can hamstring accelerators and incubators who may see promise or opportunity in verticals or companies that are outside of the fund’s purview. 
						34. Long story short, you don’t get to “experiment” with VC money. You get to make money.

			66. Coworking and Community Development are not complementary
				67. We’ve tried any number of models: paid desks, free desks, desks in trade. What has worked best for us, to date, has been the concept of free desks for “mentors in residence.” This is usually reserved for people who have been through the program, but it’s also been used for companies like Sprintly, Automattic (WordPress), and Upworthy. We established a soft baseline for participation (“You have to be actively engaged in mentoring startups in the space.”) And assessed and judged that participation anecdotally. Those not meeting our expectation were counseled to up their mentoring game or encouraged to leave the space. We gave them a few warnings.
				68. Why do we believe this is an effective model for PIE and other accelerators? At the core, accelerators are about knowledge transfer. Retaining class participants beyond their cohort allows us to more efficiently transfer that knowledge (“You shouldn’t miss that mentor talk,” “You definitely need to connect with so and so,” and “I couldn’t help hearing you were having an issue with x. Here’s how we dealt with that.”)
				69. It seems counterintuitive but we’ve learned that giving startups desks for free often creates a tighter bond and stronger commitment than asking them to pay. That is, they perceive more value in the offering than office space to be more valuable than simply cash out of pocket. They feel like a valued part of the community. And since a very important part of our role is strengthening community, we feel this emotional tie has far more value that the rent check.
				70. Long story short, we feel we’ve gotten exponentially more value out of giving desks away than we ever would have by adding a few more dollars to the revenue stream.

				78. Have a thesis
					79. You don't have to be married to it forever and it can change as often as you want. But you need one. Your thesis can be defined by market dynamics, community trends, the expertise of your mentors, the success of your startups, the desires of your patron, or any combination thereof.
					80. At PIE, we hit upon the fact that we were really good at accelerating platforms and enabling technology. Why did we get good at this? There were any number of reasons.
						81. Portland has a culture of platforms and enabling technologies
						82. We inherited the culture of the agency itself moreso than the cultures of the agency's clients.
						83. Our mentors had expertise in building platforms.
						84. Our startups happened to be focused on platforms.
						85. The risk tolerance profile for the Portland community favored platforms and enabling technologies over consumer plays because the perceived risks and challenges are lesser.
						86. We started PIE just as both the SaaS and mobile markets were exploding
				87. Know where you suck
					88. Know — don’t assume; know — what you are truly good at doing.
					89. And even more importantly? Be willing to admit where you suck. 
					90. At PIE, it quickly became obvious that we sucked at helping startups with fundraising. We were hamstrung by several things. 
						91. First, there was a small investment community in Portland. 
						92. Second, the community that was there had little appetite for the types of companies—or the risk profiles of those companies—as investments. 
						93. Third, we had not established adequate ties with investors in other regions. We had friends here and there, but we didn’t have a strong rolodex of investors whose theses matched our startup profiles.
					94. But you know what? Admitting we sucked at that — and being open with our applicants that we sucked at that — freed us up to be better at any number of other things. And made us way better and more focused on the things we were good at doing. Not only that, but it provide us with yet another measure by which to select the companies we chose.

				98. Curriculum
					105. More independent study than classroom
						106. Founders are extremely creative and driven, but they  are also intently focused on the immediate problem at hand. To them, nothing else matters but the problem they are working on right now today. Which, of course, tends to differ from startup to startup. And while those startups may _eventually_ all experience the same problem, they will not intuit that the problem exists until they encounter it. Therefore, it is our opinion that it is  nearly impossible to teach at scale in a classroom environment on an ongoing basis.
						107. However, do be on the lookout for opportunities where every startup is experiencing the same exact problem at the same exact time. Take advantage of those opportunities. But take advantage of them ad hoc, and on the fly.
						108. Some examples of these struggles that impact all founders simultaneously are learning how to meet, roughing out financial projections, pricing their product, and pitching.

						101. Presentation with Q&A
							102. As we mention above, founders only care about the problem they’re experiencing today, right now. To further the disconnect, even if a mentor provides step-by-step instructions with excruciating details, the founder will never be able to recreate the steps, moments in time, or luck that founder had. 
							103. For this reason, we suggest that mentor presentations primarily be used as an anecdotal learning experience. Not a teaching one.
							104. Your primary objective with this format is to convince your founders that they, like the mentor, are capable of succeeding. 
							104. Mentors, therefore, should avoid chest thumping. They should be comfortable sharing stories of failure, mistakes, and missteps. Things the mentors wish they had done differently. Stories about how they got lucky. And things they wish they had known during their journey. 
							105. This allows the founders to extract the content that is important and relevant to their current frame of mind and ask clarifying questions as needed.
