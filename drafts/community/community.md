## Parking lot

- The accelerator should be a reflection of the community
- It's a means of catalyzing existing community
- Be honest about your community
- You can only work with what you've got
- You have to start with the ingredients your community has, but
- you don't need to follow the existing community momentum
- You're allowed to bring different ingredients into the community, but the initial activity must start with existing assets
- Some of your community assets may have never combined before (e.g., Portland startup community and W+K), but they're still both assets to be considered
- Once that community is identified, how do you engage with it?
- Community needs a place. Since we've moved away from PIE being a physical presence, we've learned that we underestimated the positive impact and community benefits of having an actual "place."

### Beverages

(Setting up the analogy for the community engagement portion of the PIE Cookbook.)

A lot of folks dive into this whole accelerator thing thinking they can just start with the accelerator.

"Hey! Hey you! We’ve got an accelerator. Come get accelerated and stuff!"

It doesn’t work that way. Any more than starting your fancy dinner party with a big ol’ main course gets the conversation going.

That’s why you need to do some work warming up the crowd. And getting people to know one another before you dive into a more intimate setting like an accelerator. Otherwise, it will just be a bunch of people sitting around quietly chewing their food. Uncomfortably. And you’ll feel like a complete failure.

So how do you break the ice? Here are some ideas that PIE used in the early days to get the conversation going.

## Before we begin

If you haven't read Startup Communities by Brad Feld, please take the time to do so. Many of the things we did accidentally in Portland — or things which happened by luck — are clearly articulated in the book. If you're working to develop and support a nascent community, Feld's book provides a critical roadmap for that development — as well as delineating a timeline for how long you should expect that development to take.

## Want to start an accelerator? Don't start an accelerator

You don't get to start in the middle. You have to start at the beginning.

When we started the experiment with Wieden+Kennedy that became PIE, Renny and I didn't set out to build an accelerator. We just kind of stumbled into this whole thing. To be honest, it wasn't even on our list of objectives when we started. Or part of the conversation. It's just where we wound up for a time. But oddly enough — even though we never set out to build an accelerator — we managed to build a very effective one.

To summarize: Who knew?

This is a recurring theme. Throughout PIE's life, we have been part of an ongoing series of happy accidents. Starting with the relationship with W+K and kind of cascading from there.

Well, honestly, to be more accurate, it was a whole bunch of mistakes, failures, and missteps that happen to be punctuated by some happy accidents. And we have lucked our way into some things — once the timing was right and all signs pointed to an opportunity — that enabled us to solve problems for the Portland startup community. By identifying gaps and then building something to satisfy that gap. Again and again. And we're still trying to do that.

Simple, right? Well, sort of. Simple, but convoluted. So maybe give us the opportunity to be your accidental sherpa. To help you along a similarly incongruous—but beneficial—path.

If Renny and I had started with an accelerator, we're confident that we would have failed. Miserably. And that's why we're recommending that — if you're thinking about starting an accelerator — you do anything but that.

So if starting with an accelerator isn't the right place, where should folks begin? Well, how about we give you a brief timeline of PIE's existence. And maybe you'll find commonality in your community that gives you a more appropriate starting place.

Or maybe, just maybe, you'll discover that you're one of the rare few who has already done all of the legwork. One who has completed all of the prerequisites. One of those lucky few communities that can, in fact, dive straight into the deep end of the pool. Because they've been ramping up all along. And they're ready to take on that accelerator opportunity.

But if you're not there yet, please do not skip ahead. Do not pass go. There is no shortcut. It takes time.

The PIE accelerator, unbeknownst to us, started in 1995, 15 years before PIE officially became an accelerator.

It doesn't have to take that long for your community. But it did for ours.

This isn't a guide. Or a regimen. This isn't the answer. This is simply how PIE became an accelerator. There is no right timespan for this. For some communities, it happens more quickly and organically. For others, it takes a long, long, long time.

I would argue that, in many ways, we're not done. And an accelerator might not be the final answer. And we're still working toward even becoming something truly valuable and sustainable.

So with that in mind…

## Building a startup accelerator in seven easy steps

tl;dr You're not starting an accelerator. You're building community.

### Step 1: Found your own company. Or at least work at a startup.

Per Brad Feld's advice in Startup Communities, if you're going to truly succeed in building a startup community then "the leaders have to be entrepreneurs." With that in mind, we realize that PIE's journey started when Renny and I started working in startups. Sometimes as founders. Sometimes as employees of startups. But in startups. In the trenches, as it were.

On the surface, this is the price you pay for credibility.

But, more importantly, it's also this time—mired in the struggles of startups—that allows you to see the real problems and opportunities from the trenches.

And it's that direct startup experience that will inform the accelerator you want to build, eventually.
Perhaps most importantly, it's that time working with other startup types, meeting people, and building a network of intelligent and driven folks that becomes the most critical element of this first step. Because it's those people who will provide the foundation for a broader community. A community that will be critical to your accelerator. Because these are your colleagues, mentors, advisors, investors—and potential applicants.

And not just local community, mind you. Because building an accelerator takes more than just local flavor. It takes expansive and extended networks. And a multitude of viewpoints. And getting outside of your comfort zone.

### Step 2: Participate in the community.

The most important part of beginning to build community is to meet the existing community where it is, currently. Because we can guarantee—whether you think there is community or not—that there's community. It's just not evenly distributed. It's disconnected. It's in hidden pockets, here and there.

There is community already. Your challenge is to find it. And meet it. Where it lives.
PIE's founders attended coffee gatherings, happy hours, user groups, tech meet ups, startup discussions, open source gatherings, BarCamps, tradeshows, and on and on and on.

But we also did things far less organized and structured. Sometimes, we just sat in coffeeshops and struck up conversations with other laptop-wielding denizens. We talked to people both in Portland and outside of Portland. Because we needed that diverse network. And diversity of viewpoints. We tried to figure out what was going on and who was doing what.

But we did it on their turf. Not ours. We tried to provide value and get invited to their gatherings. We didn't egotistically start our own events. And in so doing—from that collaborative standpoint—we continued to build up the network that would be the most critical component of PIE: community.

### Step 3: Talk about the community.

There's something about a tree falling and no one hearing it. Community is the same way. You have to talk about it. And blog about it. And tweet about it. You have to connect it. And highlight what it's doing.

Why? Because, for the most part, community is not immediately self-aware. As such, people don't just realize that there's "a community." Even if they're deeply involved in that community. You have to tell them. And then tell them again. And again.

You have to cheerlead. You have to create a bully pulpit. And you have to use that megaphone to convince those outside of the community that the community is, in fact, real. And to encourage those who are starting to become self-aware of the community to connect more deeply with that community.
For us, those vehicles were things like Silicon Florist, our personal blogs, local publications, larger tech blogs outside of our region, and the—then nascent—social media landscape. All served as the means of talking about the Portland startup community. And to spread the belief that it existed and had the potential to be much, much more.

Yes, Virginia, there is a Portland startup community.

Note: This step is ongoing. You don't get to stop talking about the community. Ever. Keep going. Keep talking.

### Step 4: Invite the community in.

Now that your community is starting to solidify and formalize, you can start to host events. Shine a spotlight on talented community members. And invite people who would benefit from hearing those community members. Renny did this by having W+K serve as the inaugural host of Ignite Portland. And hosting events like Portland Lunch 2.0, among others.

Without—and this is critical—expecting anything in return. At all.

Don't think that you have to acquire space before this happens. You can partner with existing spaces. Or pay to rent spaces that you make accessible to others. Or this can occur in a shared space or a known resource.

You don't have to own the space, but you must do what it takes to make space available to the community.
With PIE, we were lucky enough to own space. Which had been generously donated by our patron, W+K, as part of the experiment. So we hosted community gatherings that we didn't manage. We invited people into the space. We had them hold their events in our space. We let people crash out overnight for crazy caffeine fueled coding sessions. Heck, we even hosted the first ever 30 hour nonstop livestreamed Web telethon in the space to help the community raise money for charity during the holiday season.

We made the PIE space a resource by the community, for the community.

### Step 5: Create a common space.

Events are great. But truly valuable community spaces are leveraged as a utility, all day, every day.

For PIE, forming a coworking space was the way to go. In part because Wieden had given us the space to do it. And in part because we thought it was what our community needed. It ensured that the space was being used throughout the day while making it available for events in the evening. Plus it gave the space ongoing and sustainable energy. Everybody wins.

Maybe your community needs the same thing. Or maybe it simply needs an event space that it uses throughout the day. Or maybe it needs a coffeeshop or a brewpub. Who knows? Maybe it needs a multistory complex that houses everything from startups through established businesses.

We don't know what your community needs. It's your community. There is no right answer. Or, perhaps more appropriately, there is no one answer that is right for every community.
Your task is to find the answer that solves an actual need within your community. And to find the partners and patrons who are going to help you get there. You need to create the space that your community needs to continue to thrive. And to continue the momentum you, as a community, have created.

For us, the space in the Wieden+Kennedy building afforded us opportunities for coworking and hosting events—which in turn provided all kinds of value for the community. In retrospect, there are three things we found to be most important about having a physical space:

1. As different groups in the community took advantage of the space, it created an opportunity for random collisions to occur and serendipity to thrive—from W+K and giant global brands to nascent startups. We found that those collisions created real and sustainable connections.
2. It provided a vantage point for us—the startup community and our patron—to better understand the dynamics of the community, where the momentum was, and where the gaps were. At times, it also provided us with an opportunity to simply observe, as an objective third party.
3. It served as a physical representation of the community, as a whole. So when folks were visiting town or were new to town, they had a place to land. And that space enabled others to discover and engage with the community more readily.

### Step 6: Keep doing all of that stuff. But do more of it. Faster.

Now that you've got some momentum, you've got a working space, and you've started to define your role in the community, you have to really get to work. Or maybe you have to build something else. But you get the gist.

There's more to do.

In addition to hosting, you now get to start programming your own events. And using your network to make those events interesting, engaging, and valuable. But bear in mind, that this event programming has to occur in collaboration with — not in competition to — the events we mentioned in Steps 2 and 4.

It's incredibly important that these events fill gaps. Not replicate existing content.
With PIE, we created our own programming and invited folks to attend. We held hackathons that combined the startup community with the creative community and corporate community. We offered our space for coworking sessions for the "friends of PIE." Even if that meant giving space away.

In short, we were on the constant lookout for interesting opportunities to bring our networks together. For talks. For gatherings. And for all sorts of collaboration. Because connecting our disparate communities and adding value to the broader community is what helped us establish our space as valuable, needed, and sustainable.

And then, only then, were Renny and I ready to…

### Step 7: Start an accelerator.

Now that you've done all of that work, you're ready. I mean, if it's even still needed.

At PIE, we needed to start an accelerator. The community needed it. W+K needed it. Startups needed it. Individuals needed it. First a bullhorn. Then a coworking space. Then an accelerator. Because we needed it. As a community.

But if you discover it's not needed, that's okay too.

Again, this isn't the right way to do anything. This just happens to be how PIE came into being.
Please don't take this as a roadmap to try to recreate PIE. This is just an allegory. To serve as an example of one potential path.

Whatever you choose to do—start a long journey or jump into the deep end of the pool—just remember that, in the long run, you're not building an accelerator. You're building a community.

## When we talk about community

When we talk about community, we are talking about physical community. A group of people coming together in a shared space or consistent, shared experience some kind, in a consistent physical location, where actual people interact with other actual people.

Random collisions?

An accelerator needs a community, but it will not create one.

Lots of accelerators get started with the quixotic notion that an accelerator will attract vibrant, excited entrepreneurs wherever the shingle gets hung out.

But the simple reality is that an accelerator project will not create a community.

Instead, you are carving out a subset of an existing community to create a more tightly knit one. But that initial community must exist for there to be any subset of it.

Startups won’t magically know about a new one and be interested - especially if there’s no existing track record of previous success; time-strapped VC’s will not be drawn magically, mentors will not always see it as their civic duty to give free time to a bunch of long shots, government and local entities are typically focused on job creation which is often a lagging indicator. It's highly likely that your first ‘demo day’, should you choose to have one, will not be oversubscribed. Because communities don't work that way.

Communities are particular. Communities are fueled by shared purpose.Think about the ones that matter to you - school, work, religion, family. Shared purpose makes small talk easy. So before you start your accelerator, think long and hard about the community you hope to catalyze.

Because while an accelerator won’t create a community, it can be a powerful catalyst for existing ones, or supercharge a nascent one.

## Accelerator as Community Catalyst

Be honest about the community you have

“Trying to create the next Silicon Valley”

...but dont be trapped by the community you have Had we taken the pulse of the community alone, we’d have started an Open Source accelerator

Consider mixing and matching community components to catalyze new territories

PIE grew out of a community. A few of them, actually. A disgruntled OpenSource gang, some frustrated co-founders, an agency community looking to engage meaningfully with startups.

Why would a brand give a shit? Outcomes? Issues? Opportunities? Hack days

“Free R&D”

Everyone hates the innovator

## Understanding — and working within — the existing culture of the community

Every accelerator needs a community. Every community does not need an accelerator.

Communities exist on a spectrum. Some communities don't even realize that they're communities. Others are a loosely assembled group of individuals who identify with peers and members of their community through a feeling of commonality and affinity, even though they lack definition, infrastructure, and process for formalizing that community. Still other communities are well defined, organized, and managed as communities.

[PLACEHOLDER] Provide analogies/examples of each of the communities above.

When it comes to accelerators, no one type of community has a particular advantage over any other. They all have their respective pros and cons.

Amorphous and nebulous communities, for example, have the benefit of needing the structure accelerators bring to a community. That's an upside. No pre-existing conditions or competition or toes on which to step. That's awesome. On the downside, these ill defined communities are — well — ill defined. As such, they don't have easily accessible resources into which an accelerator can immediately tap. The onus, therefore, is on the accelerator to create these assets and resources from scratch.

Conversely, a well established community — on the upside — could have a wealth of infrastructure and programmatic elements which can be leveraged by an accelerator. While on the downside, it may have pre-existing and well established players, organizations, and cultural mores that prevent an accelerator from being as effective as it can be — without spending significant political capital to navigate the existing infrastructure.

See? Pros and cons. No community is perfect.

What we're saying is that the community doesn't have to be a certain kind of community to support the concept of an accelerator. It simply has to exist. As a community. Even if the members of said community are still not fully cognizant of the community's existence or their inclusion therein.

If you, as the accelerator perceive something that behaves like community — no matter how ill defined — then there's enough there to begin.

## Accelerators function within communities

Accelerators can be a means of bringing an existing — but nebulous and ill defined — community together. Or accelerating the momentum of an organized community.

But make no mistakes. Accelerators are not a means of creating a community from scratch. And this is an assumption that most people make. Many potential accelerator founders are enamored of the concept of creating an accelerator that will somehow result in the creation of an amazing and vibrant community. It's actually the converse that is true.

Community first. Accelerator second.

To be successful, you must work within the context and culture of your existing community. You're not going to be successful trying to build something that flies in the face of the community in which you're trying to build it.

Let's see if we can provide an example from the world of tech startups.

## The next Silicon Valley.

C'mon. We've all said it. It's kind of a right of passage for any tech startup community. We're building the "next Silicon Valley."

No you're not.

No one is building the next Silicon Valley. Nor should they. They should be building the next version of Portland or Stuttgart or Jakarta. Not the next Silicon Valley. Because that's a completely unattainable archetype that flies in the face of most communities existing culture. And none of us is going to live long enough, work hard enough, or invest enough capital to see this goal through. Even if it were possible. Which it's not.

Anymore than somewhere is going to become the next Hollywood.

Look. It's not that we don't believe in you or your passion or your abilities. It's not that we don't recognize the potential upside of having a mini Silicon Valley in your backyard. Or the potential positive economic impact for your community.

I get it. It's the penultimate startup utopia. (It's not.)

We all have role models or things to which we aspire. I get it. Often, when we start new projects or set goals, we look first to the epitome of success for guidance. For something to emulate. For something to which we can aspire. And I doubt it will come as a shock to you that, for many startup communities, folks quickly gravitate toward the Bay Area as that role model. 

I know. Shocking.

It becomes the goal for what others want to be. As it appears to be. Now. Currently. And as those new people consider replicating that success, they are often wont to start where it is today. Jumping to the end result of the successful model. Rather than taking a step back to asses how that role model community actually achieved their current status. Rather than figuring out where they started. Or what elements were in place that enabled them to become what they are today.

It’s only natural. Those trailblazers make it look so easy. We never see all of the messiness. And the effort. And fuckups. We just see what it is today. With all of its media attention. And its bright and shiny benefits.

And we want that. The finished product. Without all of that ramping up and whatnot. That ramping up stuff is hard. Let’s just skip that and just make our startup scene “the next Bay Area.” Easy peasy.

But as we all know, that’s never going to happen. With a very few and extremely rare notable exceptions, there are no shortcuts to creating something lasting and sustainable. There is no diving into the deep end of the pool and learning how to swim immediately.

But there is a way to do it. And I believe it may lay in spending some time considering the underpinnings of the community itself. How it formed. Why it formed. And what trends or themes seem to replicate, time and time again, within the community. Because I think quiet undercurrent may have more influence on business success that any of us is willing to admit.

I am putting forth the hypothesis that the likelihood of building a sustainable startup community — complete with accelerators and startups and funding — has a far greater likelihood of success if, and only if, you carefully consider the history of successful businesses in your community.

What do I mean by that? Well, let’s take a look.

## A culture of wealth creation

Since its founding, the Bay Area has been driven by a particular culture: the culture wealth creation. Generation after generation.

Sure. They solve some really interesting problems along the way. But those solutions aren't the motivation. Creating wealth is.

San Francisco and the areas that surround it have always been driven by the pursuit of rapid financial gain Admittedly, I’m no San Francisco scholar. But even a rudimentary knowledge of the region reveals that the vast majority of success stories in the area are driven by the prospect (pun intended) of getting rich quick.

The gold rush. Military contracts. Semiconductors. Enterprise hardware. Internet connectivity. Personal computing. The dotcom days. SaaS. Unicorns. Decacorns. 

I’m sure I’m missing a bunch of stuff there. But you get the point. If there's a means of working extremely hard to create an extreme amount of wealth, it's highly likely to be attractive to that kind of culture.

Maybe your community has a similar kind of history and ethos. If so, you should embrace that and figure out how to make an accelerator work within that culture. But if not, don't try to create that culture.

Again, let's move beyond our adolescent dreams of emulating the Bay Area and focus, instead, on what your community does well, how the culture drives industry in your region, and how an accelerator can amplify that activity for the good of startups, investors, and the economy as a whole.

Because much like an accelerator must come to being within an existing community, a community will be far more successful following the pervading culture of a town, city, or region.

## Taking an environmental scan

So we keep hammering on this "you have to build an accelerator within an existing community" point. Because we think it's important. But once you've identified the community that is to be the protective ecosystem in which you will build your accelerator, what then?

Well, recognizing the community is just the first step. Next, you have to assess the community. What are its assets? What are its shortcomings?

Before you get visionary, you need to be realistic. So let's start there. With reality.

This can be fairly ad hoc. You don't need to engage with a bunch of high priced consultants to run focus groups and surveys on your community. Or anthropologists, sociologists, and economists who embed themselves within your community. If you want to do formal, do formal. But it doesn't have to be.

What you're hoping to answer is two very simple questions: 1. What resources does your community have? Or, to put it another way, where are the opportunities? 2. What resources are we missing? In other words, where are the gaps?

## Existing resources

A resource is great. But they fall on a spectrum. And understanding how mature that resource is can be critical.

You may have a few angel investors in town. But that doesn't mean you have an investment community. You may have a few startups in your community. That doesn't mean you have deal flow.

Even more importantly, are these resources even accessible?

The apparel industry in Portland, for example — with Nike, Adidas, Columbia, and Under Armour, among others, all boasting significant reach in town — is a hugely valuable asset. But for the most part, that asset of knowledge and an extremely seasoned mentor pool is largely inaccessible to many of the communities in Portland.

Since it's an asset that can only be accessed by a small subset of the broader community — and since that isn't our community — it's not really an asset.

So if we got some cockamamie scheme to try to build an apparel accelerator we'd be out of luck. That's not our community. Those aren't our people. And we're not their's. And as such, we'd have no ability to activate that asset.

What's that mean? That's right. That's not really an asset, is it? To put it another way, an asset is only an asset if your community and accelerator can immediately leverage those resources.

People most often seem to stumble here in terms of capital. If we had a dollar for every accelerator that tried to start a helping a highly capital intensive market with little to no capital assets at their disposal, PIE would be a late stage venture fund.

If you don't have capital, don't engage in pursuits that capital intensive. If you don't have the asset, don't plan on that asset somehow becoming magically available. Anymore than you should expect community to magically form around an accelerator.

Use, as the phrase goes, what you've got.

## Multipurpose every asset you can

What's more, it's highly likely that you're not going to just want to use that asset in a single way. You want to get as much combined value out of each asset as you can. And to ensure that the asset is deriving value from he relationship.

So ideally, you'll be seeking to leverage those assets in four ways:

- To the benefit of the early stage founders
- To the benefit of the asset
- To the benefit of the accelerator
- To the benefit of the community as a whole

## Existing gaps

Where are the gaps? Are they solvable? How entrenched are they? Create one of those annoying Venn diagrams, because those things are a thing for a reason. They actually can help you visualize where the opportunity exists. Then you can get visionary

## Having a problem assessing the community assets and needs?

Starting a coworking space is a great way to start to unearth some of the assets and gaps in the community.

## Building community

The most challenging part of building community is resisting the urge to bring the community to you. You don't get to bring the community to you until you've gone to them.

It seems counterintuitive. That when you want to be a gracious host or curator that you should first have to rely on the hospitality of others. But it's how it works.

Visit first. Participate elsewhere. Long before you create a space of your own. Because that's where the community lives. Out there. And asking them to come to you is presumptive. You need to be part of the community first.

There is a time and place for hosting. But it's not at the beginning. At the beginning you have to go where the community is.

But where do you go? Well, if you've done an effective job of assessing your community, the nodes and inflection points should be apparent. Not obvious, but apparent. Conversely, if you find yourself asking "Where is our community?" then you have more assessment work to do.

What types of events should you attend? That's easy. All of them. Attend all the things.

This phase is a continuation of the assessment phase. It will serve as a guide for the future events that you will first host. And then create. To fill in the gaps.

This can seem a bit daunting. But it's necessary.

If you're already a participant in the community, it's easier. But it's still a change in your role in the community. Moving from participant to developer or manager.

If you've recognized a leader — think Brad Feld in Boulder, Mark Suster in LA, Chris DeVore in Seattle, Jeff Slobotski in Omaha — then your engagement becomes easier still. But let's be honest. Most of us do not have these kinds of roles in our respective communities. So we have to start with more of a grassroots movement. Of participating. Like those folks above did. Before their communities — or you — knew who they were.

If you have these kinds of amazing connectors as part of your community, you're in luck. Because these folks will serve as an effective barometer to help you determine where to be. Either as a positive motivator ("They're going. I should go.") or negative motivator ("They're not going. I should go.").

If you don't have already established leaders in the community, then your job will be more difficult. And you may want to prepare yourself to become that community leader.

## Work with what you have

What if the community you discover and into which you pour energy turns out to be the wrong community? Or what if the community you have is not the community you want?

Start with what you have. And work towards what you want.

## Always remember that communities change. Constantly.

Don't get too smug once you've identified a community. Or become a participant. Or become a leader. Communities change. Constantly. Or it may be the wrong community. Or you may be the wrong person for that community. Or the community you need may be a subset of a larger community you're exploring.

Sometimes, community dynamics change. And new gaps arise. Or new challenges. Sometimes the problems you solve reveal other problems. Or opportunities.

Community development is never complete. And it is never repeatable. It's different each and every time. Worst of all, your community dynamics will continue to change even under the most effective management. It's just how communities work.

And often, that's completely okay. Because change is good for the community. Hard. But good.

Therefore, you should be constantly judging and reassessing your community to ensure it is meeting the current needs of the community.

Like any startup, communities must constantly change to meet the needs of their constituencies. Sometimes, this may result in changes that result in long time community members finding that the new version of the community no longer meets the needs that made it attractive in the first place. This is a constant challenge.

## Beware of your "community" becoming a "scene"

Community is engaged, changing, and collaborative. A scene is noisy and non participative. There are often more people attracted to a scene, but it is not nearly as productive as a community. More people doesn't mean more effective. In many cases, the opposite is true. A small community trumps a big scene any day of the week.

Scenes benefit the individual. Communities benefit the whole.

Community is hard. But it is the most critical ingredient in the accelerator recipe. Even if what it tells you is not to build an accelerator. Perhaps especially if that's the case.

Without community, you have nothing.

## Manage lightly and humbly

Be cautious of over managing and over programming your community. Communities need time to rest and breathe.

And they exist with their own momentum. While that momentum can be influenced, it cannot often be changed. You have to go with the community flow. Even if it's frustrating.

Different voices will rise and fall. Different leadership will rise and fall. You don't always have to lead. You don't always have to follow.

It is not your job to rule or manage. It is your job to develop and support.

You are simply a steward.

## Community is a product

And like any product, you must take risks, make changes, fail, stumble into unintended success, a listen to each member of the community for clues on what to do next. Always listen.

If community is a product, then community management is product management.

## And a fragile product at that

Community is not an asset that you mine indiscriminately like some wealthy oil baron. Community is the sourdough starter. Community is where you leave some part of you behind to make the next event — even the next encounter — even better.

## Sometimes the space you can charge for is not the space you should charge for

It’s counterintuitive. But sometimes — actually more often than one would think — the people you can charge for things are not the people you should charge for things. And sometimes your return on an investment is anything but a financial return. What’s more, that non-financial return is often way more valuable than a few more dollars in the bank.

At PIE, we’ve tried any number of coworking models: paid desks, free desks, desks in trade for services, as well as any number of other permutations, therein. But along that line of experiments, what has turned out to work best for us has been the concept of free desks for “mentors in residence.”

The “mentor in residence” designation is usually reserved for people who have been through the PIE program — which means they are companies in which we hold a vested interest. So asking them for rent would just be us asking for our own money back. But it’s also been used for interesting companies and contributors who happen to be in Portland, have the potential to provide some amazingly valuable insights to our startups, and who are looking for a work environment that is, well, chaotic at best. Or sometimes, it’s just for folks who happen to be visiting. It’s a malleable title.

> As part of this program, we’ve been lucky to have companies like Automattic (WordPress), Creative Market, Digital Ocean, Google, Facebook, Kato, Keen, Kickstarter, Pinterest, SendGrid, Simple, Sprintly, Techstars, Twitter, Upworthy, and Wieden+Kennedy, among others, hang out with us at PIE.

Someone from Instagram was even in the space for a few days as they were transitioning away from the Burbn concept into the insanely popular app we all know today. Short lived as it was, even that 72 hour period was interesting and informative.

## Quid pro quo

In terms of the quid pro quo for the free desks, we established a soft baseline for participation. It was pretty simple. If we gave you a desk for free, your obligation was “to be actively engaged in mentoring startups in the space.” That was it. Nothing more.

We assessed and judged that participation anecdotally. There were no hard metrics or milestones. No quantitative results. There was just an qualitative assessment. Those not meeting our expectations were counseled to up their mentoring game or were encouraged to leave the space. And even in those rare cases, we gave them a few warnings.

But wait, you say, some of those companies were going concerns. They had revenue. They weren’t early stage startups. Couldn’t PIE have charged these folks for desks? Absolutely. Did we? No.

Because while we like revenue as much as the next startup, we believe that we get far more value out of their presence than a few bucks every month.

So why — especially for coworking spaces and accelerators who are often scraping by — do we believe forgoing revenue is an effective model? Because first and foremost, at the core, accelerators should always be focused on knowledge transfer. And there is no more efficient knowledge transfer than having people who have been there and done that around.

We believe there are three particular flavors of “mentors in residence”:

1. **Permanent residence for PIE alums**. Retaining class participants beyond their cohort allows us to more efficiently transfer that knowledge from one class of PIE to another. (“You shouldn’t miss that mentor talk,” “You definitely need to connect with so and so,” and “I couldn’t help hearing you were having an issue with x. Here’s how we dealt with that.”)
2. **Permanent residence for interesting startups**. Going through an accelerator is one way to help build a company. And going through PIE is a very specific path for doing so. But it’s not the only way. And it’s not necessarily the right way. So it’s important that we have differing viewpoints for our startups. People who have built companies independently. People who have been in the Portland startup scene for years. People who have just moved here. People who have been through other accelerators. What we need and what our startups need, in a word, is variety. With diverse viewpoints. And vantage points that diverge from our homogenous existence.
3. **Temporary residence for visiting startup types**. This could be a desk, a group of desks, a conference room, or even a phone booth. It could be the use of our event space for a gathering. It could be any number of things for which we could charge money. But were we to be purely mercenary about these resources, we would run the risk losing out on conversations, missing interesting connections outside of Portland with interesting startups and investors, and potentially alienating someone who could be hugely valuable to one of our startups. So we just offer up space for free. And in so doing, we expand the Portland startup community exponentially. What’s more, we’re happily the home away from home for these folks, every time they visit Portland.

Perhaps the most important learning from this part of the PIE experiment — while painful on the bottom line from time to time — has been debunking the whole “people only value what they pay money for” bullshit.

It seems counterintuitive, but we’ve learned that giving startup types desks for free often creates a tighter bond and stronger commitment to give back than simply charging them for the use of our space — whether they live in Portland or not.

That is, they tend to perceive more value in the offering than it simply being a roof over their heads and a place to rest their laptop. It’s a community. It’s something to which they are connected. By bonds stronger than financial bonds. What’s more, they feel like a valued — and contributing — part of the community. And since a very important part of our role is strengthening community, we feel this emotional tie has far more value than the rent check.

For us, we feel we’ve gotten exponentially more value out of giving desks away than we ever would have by adding a few more dollars to the revenue stream. And we feel lucky to have had the wherewithal to even engage in this experiment.

Of course we’re only talking about desks here. This could apply to any number of offerings. Or services. Or products. Sometimes you simply shouldn’t charge for what you can charge for. Because then, instead of gaining something, you’re actually losing far more.

## Brands are part of the community, independent of the community, and a community in their own right — all at the same time

One of the most challenging aspects of working with brands — our lingo for for-profit corporations — is that they can play multiple roles in a community, no role whatsoever, or perform as an insular community all by themselves. This makes them both an intriguing and attractive partner for accelerators — but can make them an equally frustrating partner, as well.

Proceed with caution. But definitely proceed if the opportunity avails itself.

### Part of the community

### Independent of the community

### Brand as community

Like any community, brands have to honestly assess what assets they bring to the table, as far as accelerators go. In our experience, this process can be as difficult — if not mores — than a typical community assessing its strengths and weaknesses.

Generally, this assessment results in two outcomes — neither of which is terribly honest.

One outcome is that the brand thinks it has every asset at its disposal. And therefore, can engage in any type of accelerator it chooses. This hubris, while understandable, is often incorrect. No matter how global the brand, it is highly likely that the brand is expert in certain areas. And it is this expertise that the brand show focus on as the key asset.

Even more challenging? This key asset is often the thing the brand finds to be the most boring part of its business.

We'll get into that later.

The second outcome is the polar opposite of the first. And it occurs with all sizes of companies, even global brands. That outcome is the assumption that the company isn't "innovative" or that it has no assets that would be of use to a startup or early stage founder.

These are brands that either 1) choose not to play at all or 2) determine the only way to engage with the startup community is to outsource the effort to a third party that "gets it."

Like the first outcome, this flawed assumption is a result of the brand not being honest about what assets it possesses and how those assets might be applied to help startups.
