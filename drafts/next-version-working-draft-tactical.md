## Activity examples 

### Cooking class
With a name like PIE, it should come as little surprise that a number of our activities revolve around food. And when you have that much creative talent in one room, sometimes it's refreshing to give folks a different outlet for that creativity — especially one that doesn't involve banging on a keyboard. 

One activity that met both our food and creativity needs was a cooking class. For the first couple of years, we partnered with a local food accelerator that had commercial kitchen space. They put together a menu, taught our founders to prepare a dish from scratch, and then the entire group had the opportunity to share in the creations, family style. 

Everyone — no matter how well attuned they were to a kitchen — was out of his or her element. And it put everyone on equal footing. Best of all, there were always a few unexpected surprises when we discovered the true chefs in our midst.

Each year we did this resulted in the best family dinner of the class. 

### Alumni vs new class kickball or picnic 
### Away from the computer/office activities 
### Mixers + happy hours
we’ve done hot sauce tasting, cheese and wine pairings, etc

### Family open house
a lot of program companies have families.  It’s nice to give family and friends an opportunity to check out the space

Admittedly we could do a better job of fostering the community among all of our classes, but at the very least there is an understanding that they can count on one another for support.
