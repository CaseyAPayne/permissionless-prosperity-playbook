# Graduating from the program | DEMO DAY

Graduation requirements can be modified to fit your programs needs or specialities. Most, if not all, programs culminate with a demo day. Companies give a 6-8 minute pitches of their product in front of an audience that can be made up of a combination of stakeholders, investors, mentors, media, and/or community. 

We believe that the focus of demo day should be about gaining attention, not funding.  Check don’t get written at demo days, but conversations get started.  Your demo day can be as large or small, open or private, as makes sense for your program.  

But while all of the above is true, it is important to understand that demo days are regularly occurring events, meaning, you’re going to work very hard to get attention from the media and investors, and you still might not get it. Their dance cards are typically full. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have one, because it’s important to have something that signifies the culmination of the program.

You should also consider the demo day goals of your teams and come up with ways to help them reach them.  Can you get the investors or potential new client they're courting at demo day?  Help them set up a dinner afterwards, or drinks even. 

The hand holding doesn’t stop just because they’ve gone on stage.  

But on to the planning! Here is a look at how we handle ours, some suggestions, and some stats for context:

We believe it’s important to put just as much effort and energy into the event of demo day, as the companies put into their pitches. For many, this day signifies as their public launch and it is our responsibility to make their splash as big as it can be.  

To help you stay on schedule, we're sharing this [PIE Demo Day: Run of Show document](/source/documents/pie-Demo-Day-Run-of-Show.xlsx).

## Logistics

### Invites
We manage our invites through Eventbrite and reserve groups of tickets for Investors, Media, Friends and Family, and Community. This enables us to control guest numbers within each group.  There is no cost to attend demo day, but you can make the invite password protected if that makes sense for your event.
 
### Venue
Ideally you'll find one that that not only meets your needs for capacity, but can also handle the technical requirements you’ll have.  Make sure that your venue gives you time for walk-thrus with the presenters as well as rehearsal time. Bonus if you find one where you can host your post presentation reception (we’ll talk about those in a bit).  We had our first at a locally owned theatre and served popcorn.  We’ve since held it at a nicer venue.  The details are important here.  It’s like the saying goes, dress for the job you want to have – find a venue that matches the level you’re aiming for.

As a reference we used the main theatre and mezzanine for our reception here: http://www.pcs.org/rent-the-armory/

### Technical requirements
#### Number one rule
Set your presenters and your audience up for success.  Having the right equipment will make your presenters and your program feel more polished.

#### Projector + Screen
Make sure that the projector and the screen are large enough that any one in the house can see.  Set your screen up in a place on stage so that presenters aren’t standing right in front of their presentations. 

#### Confidence monitors
**THESE ARE MANDATORY**, or at least should be.  While we expect our speakers to be prepared for anything during their presentations, ya know, technical glitches, power outages, booing (kidding), we like to provide them with a little bit of a security blanket.  1 for current screen, 1 for presenter notes.

#### Lav + hand mics
Presenters should use lav mics, period.  This is especially crucial if they’re going to be transitioning their own slides via a clicker.  Too many things to hold and they’ll find themselves juggling.  Hand mics should be reserved for anyone doing presenter introductions or show opening and closing notes.  

#### Wifi
A definite nice to have, but can get expensive if your venue isn’t equipped.  

Livestreaming: Another nice to have.  We reach another 1000+ viewers by having a live stream of our demo day.  This is great for folks who don’t have time to make a trip just for your event, but would still like to participate.

#### Entertainment/music: 
Most demo days have their companies walk on stage to a theme song.  We like to take that up a notch and have a live band perform the song.  The band stays on stage and adds a little extra flavor to the whole show.  Year after year, we get a ton of compliments on the band.  If you can swing it, you should.

### What to wear:
We have teams wear logo branded t-shirts, each team has a different color.  Why do we do this? Well because after 1.5-2 hour long presentations, folks tend to forget names and faces, but can recognize a t-shirt color / logo that they wanted to talk to.  Trust us.  It makes a difference.  How do you decide what colors folks wear? Well, you can let them fight to death, or you can decide for them.  Logos are either black or white - keep it simple.

### Demo day swag:
Sigh.  You could do it, but do you wanna?  (inside joke ftw) It’s really not worth the time or the money to create swag specific to your demo day.  We know because we’ve done it.  We’ve even created awesome notebooks with pages dedicated to each team so that while they present the user could take notes on that teams specific page AND it had their business card attached to the page! Pure genius and a total waste of money that no one used or cared about.  

### Post show reception (1.5 hours)
To facilitate conversations post presentations we host a private reception for our companies, media, and investors, immediately after curtain call.  Work with teams to find out who they’d like to attend and help make those introductions happen.  This is not a wrap party, but you should provide some bites and drinks. After all, the majority of the attendees just sat through an entire presentation. 

### Finally, food
Producing an event like demo day takes a lot of time.  Not only are you managing each individual company and making sure their presentation is ready, but you’re managing the entire show.  

### Denouement: Repair to dinner
One of the things we tried time and time again was to get the startups to take mentors and potential investors out to dinner after the event. From giving them money to do so to planning their itinerary. It never really worked as expected, but we still think it's a great way of continuing the conversations in a more intimate environment.
