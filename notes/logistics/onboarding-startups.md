# Onboarding new startups

It’s important to recognize that this is a large transition for your companies.  Some might have even relocated completely to participate in your program. And if they haven’t, well, going from planning your own schedule and working out of a coffee shop, to a structured accelerator program is still a big transition.  

Do what you can to help mitigate an issues your teams might have as they join you. Some welcome wagon items may include 
- Housing suggestions or referrals
- Maps of the city
- Information on public transportation
- Places to eat or grocery shop

What would you want to know if you were moving to a new city or even a new office? Your teams will want to know that too.

## Take it slow

We’ve found that too much scheduling the first few days can lead to a bumpy kickoff for companies starting the program. The first day of your program should be dedicated to introducing teams to one another, giving an office tour, letting people get settled and then finally, letting them get to work. 

We recommend providing documentation and creating some sort of reference for startups so they know what to expect as the program becomes more structured. It’ll also help them be clear on deadlines for deliverables and the expectations for them.

Here’s how we’ve used:
- [What you’re getting yourself in to](/notes/logistics/onboarding-what-youre-getting-in-to.md) 
- [Woohoo! Here’s what to expect on your first day](/notes/logistics/onboarding-what-to-expect.md). (Along with acceptance letter)

Consider providing these docs along with a welcome basket of swag.  Again, it’s about making folks feel welcome. The more comfortable your teams feel in the space the sooner they’ll be able to hit the ground running and work — and begin building up the trust that will enable them to succeed in this environment.
