Dear awesome entrepreneur or PIE-curious type who has signed up for our mailing list,

Hope you're doing well. How is your startup? Oh. Really? That's awesome. This is fortuitous timing then...

PIE (Portland Incubator Experiment) — a startup accelerator that gives you some cash, three months of intensive mentorship, and up to nine months of office space — has opened applications for our 2014 class.

We'd love to have you apply to be part of it: 
http://piepdx.com

What's PIE? It is a startup accelerator run in collaboration with Wieden+Kennedy, arguably one of the most creative communications companies in the world. We've been home to alums like Orchestrate, Urban Airship, Simple, Cloudability, Lytics, Switchboard, and more. 

And we're hoping to be the home for your startup.

How do we make that happen? Well, you have to apply. The PIE application form features many of the standard incubator/accelerator questions. Be prepared to talk about the awesome product you're building, the dream team you've got behind it, and even why you think you'd be a good addition to the PIE portfolio.

Please submit your application either via the PIE site (http://piepdx.com) or via AngelList (URL).

Long story short, we'd love to help you succeed. So, if you're sitting there working on your dream, you owe it to yourself to throw your hat into the ring for the next class of PIE. It could be that push you need to make your startup fantasy into a reality.

Deadline is [DATE]. (Class begins in [DATE].) So don't wait!

We're looking forward to seeing your application.

Hugs and kisses,
