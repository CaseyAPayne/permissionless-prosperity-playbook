Folks,

We've officially hit the one week countdown. Stressful, but you're good to go though right? You just like to experience the rush of waiting until the last possible second to hit submit? 

I get it. Most big decisions for your company, and probably life in general, are best handled with a heavy dose of procrastination.

So procrastinate away my friends! Just make sure you're fully prepared when you sit down to finish that application.  Here is a little to-do list to make sure you live up to the ultimate last-minute submitter status title.

1. Read our FAQ blog post - everything you've wanted to ask about the program, but were waiting until the last minute:

2. Review the application cheat sheet - don't worry, we can only see viewers as "Anonymous Frog" or Rick's personal favorite, "Anonymous Chupacabra" so your secret preparedness will in fact, be secret:

3. Chat with a mentor - if you do item number two, you'll know that we love referrals from our mentors.  Bonus, if the FAQ didn't answer all of your questions they could be a good resource.  I like to call this a two birds, one stone, to-do task. For a list of mentors, check:

If you do those three things, you'll definitely be ready for the most important one.  Ready for it?

4. Actually fill out the application and hit submit:

That's it.  It's really just that simple.  Four easy to-do items and you could be on your way to joining the 2014 class of PIE.

So get on it. Because we're really looking forward to meeting you and your awesome team.

Sincerely,
