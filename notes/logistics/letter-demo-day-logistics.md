Oh hey there,

What are you doing on Friday?  Just checking to see if you had any ideas.  It's not a big deal or anything. It's just Friday.

Wait... Oh gosh, Friday is PIE Demo Day 2014! How silly of us to forget. You're coming right? Oh good! We're so glad you got your ticket before they sold out.

You did, right?

It's going to be awesome. This year’s Demo Day will feature presentations from our portfolio companies and highlights from our latest experiments. We’ll also take a look back at five years of PIE and the amazing startups with whom we have had the pleasure to work.

Having the event sell out so quickly made us both happy and sad. You see, we like to think of Demo Day as a community event. We want everyone to be there. But running out of room put a bit of a damper on that.

But turn that frown upside down. We're happy to announce that our friends at eBay have been kind enough to host a PIE Demo Day simulcast. They have room for 100 folks to join them! So that even more of the community can enjoy PIE Demo Day in person.

So whether you're with us at the theater, hanging out with our friends at eBay, or watching us on your favorite device at your favorite location, we look forward to sharing with you the awesomeness of the last five years of PIE.

Best,
PIE management

ps: We're also celebrating our five year anniversary.  We like bourbon, but, if you're traditional, you can get us some sort of wood carving.
