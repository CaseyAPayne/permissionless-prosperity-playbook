# Acceptance letter

Hello [NAME]

We'd like to take a minute and thank you for your patience while we took the time to review the applicants with our mentors and program partners.  Their insight was immensely valuable and we didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to engage them.

At this point, we would like to extend an offer to the [YOUR COMPANY] team to join us for this next class of [PROGRAM NAME], starting [DATE], pending completion of due diligence.  Attached you'll find an offer letter outlining our terms, along with due dates, as well as a standard background check form and a statement of capitalization document. The due dates are firm and meeting them allows you to get the most out of the program right out the gate. That said, we always enjoy playing favorites with teams who get their documentation submitted early.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks
