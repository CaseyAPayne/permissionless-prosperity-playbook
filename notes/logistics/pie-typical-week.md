# Typical week in PIE

We often get asked, "What's a typical week like in an accelerator?" And while the term "typical week" is an oxymoron for PIE, there are some things that occur with enough regularity — and provide enough structure for participants — that we can describe them.

So here's an imperfect look at a typical week at PIE:

## Monday

8:00AM 
Staff arrives, meets about week's upcoming events. Some startups are already working.

10:00AM 
Workspace is full. All startups have arrived. Staff holds one-on-one meetings with each team. 

5:00PM
Family Dinner starts. Founders and staff leave the workspace to have dinner together. Non-founding team members remain in the space working. 

7:00PM 
Family Dinner ends. Startups return to workspace and continue working. Staff returns to space. Compares notes. Continues peer mentoring momentum from Family Dinner.

8:00PM Workspace is about half full with the founders who prefer the late shift. Staff remains online in the chat room or accessible via email.

## Tuesday

8:00AM Staff arrives. Continues making mentor connections for startups based on issues raised during family dinner. Typically two or three mentors per startup per issue. 

10:00AM Workspace is full.

12:00PM Catered lunch in the workspace. Some startups sit together and chat. Others simply eat at their desks. (Their is no required socializing. Just a request that the founders take time to eat.)
