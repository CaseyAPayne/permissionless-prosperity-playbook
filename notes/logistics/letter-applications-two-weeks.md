Hi there friend,

Can you believe there are 14 days left until PIE applications close? That is literally 336 hours you can use to write the Best. Application. Ever.

(Please don't spend 336 hours filling out the application. It's not that long!)

Oh, but you're having writers block? Not sure if PIE is right for you?  Can't decide what to have for lunch today... that is always a tough one!  Well fear not, we've got some light reading material over at the PIE blog that just might help you with your woes.

Try this one for some advice on picking the best accelerator for you:

Need to hear from an alum? Orchestrate's CEO, Tony Falco has got you covered:
