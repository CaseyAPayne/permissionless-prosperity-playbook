# Encouraging/enforcing bonding with peers

This is an important part of our program and one that we feel is often overlooked by others.  We believe that we aren’t just graduating individual companies from our program, but communities.  Because, ya know, it takes a village.  But this community wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for the activities and time we put into creating opportunities for peer mentoring and bonding.  It’s important to use a range of bonding activities, that don’t just involve drinking - be inclusive.  Below is a list of things we’ve done.
	
## Activity examples 
- Cooking class - that turns into a more casual family dinner
- Alumni vs new class kickball or picnic 
- Away from the computer/office activities 
- Mixers + happy hours - we’ve done hot sauce tasting, cheese and wine pairings, etc
- Family open house: a lot of program companies have familes.  It’s nice to give family and friends an opportunity to check out the space

Admittedly we could do a better job of fostering the community among all of our classes, but at the very least there is an understanding that they can count on one another for support.
