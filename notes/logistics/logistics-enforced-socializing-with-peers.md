# Encouraging/enforcing bonding with peers

This is an important part of our program and one that we feel is often overlooked by others.  We believe that we aren’t just graduating individual companies from our program, but collaborative groups who will improve and enhance our existing community. 

But this doesn't necessarily happen organically. It takes effort. And intent. That's why we've learned to put time into creating opportunities that enable those peer bonds to form, even on a short timescale. 

We've also learned that it’s important to use a range of bonding activities. A beer or cocktail is fine every once in a while, but it's important to break out of the startup stereotype. Plan activities that don’t just involve drinking. Heck, maybe even plan some activities that are healthy (gasp) or educational. 

The basic rule is: Be inclusive. And provide a range of options. Not every option will work for every participant. 

Below is a list of things we’ve done.
	
## Activity examples 

### Cooking class
With a name like PIE, it should come as little surprise that a number of our activities revolve around food. And when you have that much creative talent in one room, sometimes it's refreshing to give folks a different outlet for that creativity — especially one that doesn't involve banging on a keyboard. 

One activity that met both our food and creativity needs was a cooking class. For the first couple of years, we partnered with a local food accelerator that had commercial kitchen space. They put together a menu, taught our founders to prepare a dish from scratch, and then the entire group had the opportunity to share in the creations, family style. 

Everyone — no matter how well attuned they were to a kitchen — was out of his or her element. And it put everyone on equal footing. Best of all, there were always a few unexpected surprises when we discovered the true chefs in our midst.

Each year we did this resulted in the best family dinner of the class. 

### Alumni vs new class kickball or picnic 
### Away from the computer/office activities 
### Mixers + happy hours
we’ve done hot sauce tasting, cheese and wine pairings, etc

### Family open house
a lot of program companies have families.  It’s nice to give family and friends an opportunity to check out the space

Admittedly we could do a better job of fostering the community among all of our classes, but at the very least there is an understanding that they can count on one another for support.
