# Creating a cadence

One of the most critical roles for the accelerator staff is managing the cadence of the class. Both in terms of introducing stressors and pulling pressure release valves, as necessary.

There is no prescribed timing here. You add more pressure when it's needed. And you try to break the tension when it's needed. You just have to play it by ear.

# Three months

PIE chose to run our program for a three month intensive period. (We ran the first class for four and half months, and it seemed to be too long. So we shortened. We'll get into why it seemed long.)

## Three months is a very short time

Most corporations, governments, and larger organization often question how we can possibly get anything done in three months. "Three months seems so short." 

And it is. It's a short intensive period of incredibly stressful work. Piled on top of the long period of incredibly stressful work that is building a startup. 

And if companies aren't careful, the three months can slip by very quickly. Without much to show for it. A few skipped mentor meetings. A talk or two. And suddenly it's Demo Day. Just like that. 

## Three months is a very long time

But fact of the matter is, when you're in the thick of it, three months is an incredibly long time. Especially when you're breaking it into minutes.

From the PIE starts until Demo Day begins is about 130,000 minutes. And each one is critical. 

But over that length of time, it's incredibly hard to keep a sustained sprint going. It's like running toward a goal somewhere off in the distance. Like trying to realize a strategy without any tactics. 

So even the three months has to be broken down into smaller chunks. To manage the cadence of the class. To manage the stress. And perhaps, most importantly, to give the startups a sense of progress over the course of the class. 

By class three (Coconut Creme) we had learned to break the class into three marathons, each about a month a piece. A series of stages and gates that culminated in the performance at Demo Day. 

Here's how we broke it out:

### Product (Month 1)

Because PIE classes generally consisted of groups of developers who understood how to build products, we started in a place of strength and confidence: product development. 

The challenge? Be ready to demo the current version of the company's product in front of the others startups in the class. The deadline was one month into the class. And it was a required activity. 

For some, this was a relatively simple request and in line with their product development schedules. For others, it required a great deal of effort to meet the milestone.

But that led to some interesting things, as well.

Those who were further ahead on product often discovered that they lacked the language to effectively convey what they were building. Worse yet, they sometimes that the current version of the product was difficult, if not impossible, to demo to a diverse audience. 

We get to question assumptions, clarify utility, and make suggestions, as a class. In a group environment. Companies get to respond directly to queries, jot down feature ideas, and generally scratch their head a great deal and ask "Why **did** we do it that way?"

So month one, get the product momentum going. And reward those who are making progress. Because that's going to be the crux of everything going forward. 

It's a safe place to start. Because we choose companies that have a solid developer or development team. And its gives both the developer and business cofounders the chance to show off what they're doing to a trusted group of peers. (After one month of accelerator stress, those bonds have already formed.)
