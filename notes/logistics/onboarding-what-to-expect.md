# Getting Started

We’re excited to have you finally join us at [PROGRAM NAME] in a few weeks. Before you get here, you might find the following helpful. Have a read and feel free to reach out with any questions.

First up, check to make sure you’ve had submitted all of these forms:

- Offer letter + Contract
- Background Check forms
- General Info Form: Contact / T-shirt sizes / Food
- Non-disclosure Agreement
- Anything else?

When you arrive on [START DATE], you’ll find a pod set up for your company. Feel free to make that pod yours—some people bring their monitors, photos, flowers, foot hammocks...whatever makes you comfortable. We’ll take you on a brief tour and give you info on facilities/timeline.
