# Should you have technical issuesâ€¦

You're running as fast as a startup. Sometimes, things can go wrong. It happens. And it's happened to PIE a lot. A lot. So we thought we would provide a sample "Oopie" letter for you to use. Because you're going to screw up. Get used to it.

## SUBJECT: We screwed up. Let's fix this.

****************************************
NOTE: We're contacting you regarding applications for the PIE class of 2014, which closed April 30, 2014. If you did not apply for this class, please feel free to disregard this message.
****************************************

Howdy,

At PIE, we like startups. It's why we started this whole experiment in the first place. So, whenever we have the chance, we opt for using startup products as part of our process. Whether they are PIE companies or not.

We just like supporting startups.

Most of the time, taking these calculated risks is positive all around, for both PIE and the startup. But every once in a while we encounter some issues. Which brings us to today's email.

Unfortunately, we are experiencing an issue on the application platform we tried out for this class. A handful of folks have reached out to us, seeking confirmation that their application went through, as they did not receive the confirmation email. When we went searching, those folks didn't turn up in the database.

### CURRENT SITUATION

We're still working to diagnose the problem. And applications have officially closed. But given the issues, we are now put in the uncomfortable position of having to ask these already overtaxed entrepreneurs to resubmit their applications.

Again, this has only been an issue for folks who 1) Submitted their application via the PIE site and 2) Did NOT receive an email confirmation. If you applied via AngelList, you're good to go. Additionally, if you applied via Google Docs, you are okay.

The startup is working with us to figure out the problem, but there is no simple explanation or reason why.  Long story short, we're embarrassed and sorry and still trying to figure out how to resolve the issue and retrieve the data.

But at least they're getting some good bug reports, right? (That's what we call looking at the bright side.)

### NEXT STEPS

For those of you who are affected by this issue, again we apologize. We've created a Google Form to apply to PIE as a backup. If you are among those folks affected and would like to resubmit that way, you may. We will keep that form live until May 6 so that you have some breathing room.

Alternately, if you completed the cheat sheet, we will happily take that in place of the formal application. As this is an issue on our side of things, no one will be penalized. Please try to get that to us as soon as you can.

We know how stressful applying can be. We want you to know that we are doing everything in our power to find a solution, because we value the time and effort you spent working on them.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions. Thank you for your patience and understanding while we sort this out.

And again, our apologies. We're truly sorry to be in this situation with you.

Sincerely,
