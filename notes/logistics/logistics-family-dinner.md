# Family Dinner

One of the concepts that PIE almost immediately borrowed from Y Combinator was the concept of "Family Dinner," although admittedly, our version of the gathering changed and morphed over time.

## Family Dinner 0.9 Beta (Coworking version)

The original PIE Family Dinner had very little to do with dinner. It was held on a weekly basis — usually a Thursday around 4:00PM — and consisted of a group of folks grabbing a beer and sitting around chatting about what they were experiencing. We only called it Family Dinner because that's what YC called their gathering. And we liked the implications of family and strengthening the connections among the members of the PIE folks.

As far as participants, it tended to be a mixture of folks from early stage startups and other individual contributors working out of the space.  There were a few regular attendees. But the mix changed and morphed from week to week. Conversations ranged from business to personal life to business' impact on personal life.

Then something interesting began to happen. Rather than simply sitting around and engaging in small talk, folks began to share issues and problems they were having. They began to explore the stress and emotions of running a startup. And they began to shed the "entrepreneurial veneer" of "Everything is awesome!" to reveal what was really happening. And to start to ask for help.

As Family Dinner moved from Happy Hour to Reality Hour, something interesting began to happen. More folks attended. More folks participated. More folks shared. And more folks were encouraged to share. 
  
> Rather than opting for voluntary participation, the weekly event became an exercise in peer mentoring. 

Each person who arrived was required to talk about what they were going through that week. In turn, other folks around the table were required to comment, critique, and collaborate to help that individual. Family Dinner began to solve problems — or identify problems as intractable. 

Family Dinner problems began to take three distinct forms:

1. **Been there done that.** An individual would highlight a problem that they had experienced. That problem had already been solved by someone else around the table. The two parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue. 
2. **Now, that's interesting.** An individual would raise an issue that no one had ever dealt with previously, and yet folks were motivated to solve collaboratively. Multiple parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue.
3. **Stop. Do not pass Go.** An individual would raise an issue that folks had tried to solve before, but it would be defined to be a completely intractable problems with no solution. Rather than continue to struggle, the individual would be encouraged to move on — or move around — that problem.

But it wasn't without its flaws. Some folks begin commanding more airtime than others. So we put a time limit on it. And enforced a requirement for everyone to talk. We tried to create a culture of collaboration. Where everyone was getting value out of the gathering. Not just a few squeaky wheels.
