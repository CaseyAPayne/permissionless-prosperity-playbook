# Family Dinner

One of the concepts that PIE almost immediately borrowed from Y Combinator was the concept of "Family Dinner," although admittedly, our version of the gathering changed and morphed over time.

## Family Dinner 0.9 Beta (Coworking version)

The original PIE Family Dinner had very little to do with dinner. It was held on a weekly basis — usually a Thursday around 4:00PM — and consisted of a group of folks grabbing a beer and sitting around chatting about what they were experiencing. We only called it Family Dinner because that's what YC called their gathering. And we liked the implications of family and strengthening the connections among the members of the PIE folks.

As far as participants, it tended to be a mixture of folks from early stage startups and other individual contributors working out of the space.  There were a few regular attendees. But the mix changed and morphed from week to week. Conversations ranged from business to personal life to business' impact on personal life.

Then something interesting began to happen. Rather than simply sitting around and engaging in small talk, folks began to share issues and problems they were having. They began to explore the stress and emotions of running a startup. And they began to shed the "entrepreneurial veneer" of "Everything is awesome!" to reveal what was really happening. And to start to ask for help.
