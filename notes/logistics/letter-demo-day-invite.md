Reader!

Is that you? It's been so long since we've last talked I barely recognized you. Looks like you had a great summer. Us? Well, thanks for asking. Our summer has been a busy one. But we're excited to share it with you.

Have you been keeping up with our blog?  The PIE team has been working on some interesting experiments this year — solo founders, teen entrepreneurs, and more.

Solo founders:

Sound interesting? Want to know more? Well, you're in luck. You can hear about all of the experiments, projects, and awesome startups at our annual PIE Demo Day.

And it's not much longer now. In fact, we know that PIE Demo Day is in 23 days, 23 hours, 36 minutes or so and counting. Because to keep the pressure palpable, we've created a bot to constantly remind the teams just how much… err little time they've got left until they're on stage.

I mean, just in case the looming countdown clock near the kitchen isn't motivation enough.

But the pressure isn't just on them, dear email list subscriber. No, no. Now, it's your turn to race the clock, as well. Because these PIE Demo Day tickets? They aren't going to last forever.

Please join us October 24th at 2pm at the Gerding Theatre in Portland, Oregon, when we'll debut the companies of our 2014 class.

We'd love to have you there. RSVP today!

See you soon!

P.S. Did we mention that PIE is five years old? We'll have some interesting things happening at Demo Day to celebrate. *hint hint*
