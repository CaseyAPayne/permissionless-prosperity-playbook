# Onboarding

One of the biggest mistakes most accelerators make — and we've made it a few times — is with onboarding. Or, to put it another way, assuming that participants realize what the accelerator is designed to do, what resources are available, and how to make best use of those resources.

If you're building an early stage tech accelerator, you can sometimes skate by without doing a great deal of onboarding. And just get lucky. 

Why? Because most early stage tech companies are familiar with the concept of accelerators. They know what they are designed to do. And they understand, at a high level, what they're supposed to get out of the accelerator.

Other industries? Not so much. The accelerator is not a common concept. So  we've found that assuming folks will know how to engage is a huge mistake. You have to tell them.
