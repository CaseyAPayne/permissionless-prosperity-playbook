# Family Dinner

Arguably one of the most important parts of the program, family dinner is a weekly gathering exclusively for our company founders to come together, share status updates and gives guidance to one another over dinner. We’ve found that only talking about each other’s successes tends to discourage any folks who are further behind or have had a rough week, so we keep family dinner conversations strictly to topics where founders could use help and support.  Think of it as it a support group over dinner.

Having a gathering like this is crucial to the (mental) health of your program and founders and will deepen the connections between companies.  Peer mentoring is not something that can be forced, but in a setting like family dinner, it is only natural that folks will offer help to their fellow founders.
 
Here are a few tips for how to effectively run a family dinner – because it’s not just as simple as ordering food.
 
For a program of 6-8 companies, dinner usually run for an hour and a half.  Any longer than that and folks will start tuning out, and trust us, it will go longer than that if you’re not in control.  To avoid dinners that drag on, help your founders either cut to the chase, by calling out specific issues you know they’re having and could use help on or know when to politely cut folks off and move to the next company.  You don’t want to discourage any dialog that happens, but you do want to be mindful of everyone’s times.  Suggest they continue the conversation post dinner.
 
As a management team, it is your responsibility to know what buttons to push and what levers to pull, to get your founders to open up.  Group sharing might not come naturally at first, so it is important to create a safe space to facilitate sharing.  Adopt the “what you hear at family dinner, stays at family dinner” motto or a Friend-DA. 
 
These dinners are always open to past class, and if you’re running your dinners right, your alumni will be regulars.
 
We recommend hosting your dinners on-site rather than at a restaurant, unless you can get a private room. Having the meal catered means it’s easier for folks to get up from their desk and join, rather than being tempted to go home and stay there before joining you at restaurant.
 
Unless teams are traveling, consider family dinner mandatory.

The original PIE Family Dinner had very little to do with dinner. It was held on a weekly basis — usually a Thursday around 4:00PM — and consisted of a group of folks grabbing a beer and sitting around chatting about what they were experiencing. We only called it Family Dinner because that's what YC called their gathering. And we liked the implications of family and strengthening the connections among the members of the PIE folks.

As far as participants, it tended to be a mixture of folks from early stage startups and other individual contributors working out of the space.  There were a few regular attendees. But the mix changed and morphed from week to week. Conversations ranged from business to personal life to business' impact on personal life.

Then something interesting began to happen. Rather than simply sitting around and engaging in small talk, folks began to share issues and problems they were having. They began to explore the stress and emotions of running a startup. And they began to shed the "entrepreneurial veneer" of "Everything is awesome!" to reveal what was really happening. And to start to ask for help.

As Family Dinner moved from Happy Hour to Reality Hour, something interesting began to happen. More folks attended. More folks participated. More folks shared. And more folks were encouraged to share. 
  
> Rather than opting for voluntary participation, the weekly event became an exercise in peer mentoring. 

Each person who arrived was required to talk about what they were going through that week. In turn, other folks around the table were required to comment, critique, and collaborate to help that individual. Family Dinner began to solve problems — or identify problems as intractable. 

Family Dinner problems began to take three distinct forms:

1. **Been there done that.** An individual would highlight a problem that they had experienced. That problem had already been solved by someone else around the table. The two parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue. 
2. **Now, that's interesting.** An individual would raise an issue that no one had ever dealt with previously, and yet folks were motivated to solve collaboratively. Multiple parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue.
3. **Stop. Do not pass Go.** An individual would raise an issue that folks had tried to solve before, but it would be defined to be a completely intractable problems with no solution. Rather than continue to struggle, the individual would be encouraged to move on — or move around — that problem.

But it wasn't without its flaws. Some folks begin commanding more airtime than others. So we put a time limit on it. And enforced a requirement for everyone to talk. We tried to create a culture of collaboration. Where everyone was getting value out of the gathering. Not just a few squeaky wheels.
