# PIE Cheat Sheet

Filling out an online application can be intimidating. What if I screw it up? What if I say the wrong thing and can't change it? What if I lose my work? That's why PIE created a cheat sheet that allowed companies to review and prepare answers for the questions before they began the online form. 

That "cheat sheet" appears in full below.

## PIE Cheat Sheet
Thank you for your interest in PIE, the Portland Incubator Experiment. PIE is a partnership among leading brands, technology innovators, and Wieden+Kennedy — the largest privately held advertising and communications company in the world. It serves as a hub for community, entrepreneurship, and creative thinking.

Each year, we invite startups to join us for nine months — three months for an accelerator program and an additional six months of office space as they gain their footing. To qualify, startups must go through a formal application process. 

Since no one really likes filling out forms, we provide the following cheat sheet so that you and your team can compose your answers prior to filling out the official application. Simply select “Make a copy…” or “Download as” from the “File” menu in Google Docs.

Applications are due [DATE]. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required. We will only accept applications submitted via the PIE application form or via AngelList.
 
Let’s get started.

### PRODUCT
We’re really interested in what you’re building and why it’s going to change the world. So let’s start there, shall we?
- Name of your product*:
- URL:
- AngelList profile:
- How are you telling the story of your product? Give us a link where we can experience that story. In whatever form you like. It could be a video or a demo walkthrough or an Instagram image of the sketch on the back of a napkin.
- Dream big but write concisely. What will your product do? You’ve got 560 characters. C'mon. That's like four whole tweets, Tolstoy. (And yes, we will count each and every character.)*
- Who are your current/future customers?
- Who are your primary competitors?
- What scares you most about your product?
- Why does your product matter? Why are people going to love it? Why is the competition going to hate it?
- Why are you and your co-founders the right team to make this happen? (This is what we call a “segue.”)

### PEOPLE 
Tell us a little bit about the team that's going to be spending an incredibly stressful three months with us -- and a whole bunch of other startups. Because if we're going to be burning the midnight oil together building something awesome, we'd like some more details. (NOTE: The primary contact will be automatically added to the PIE email list.)

#### Co-founder 1 (Primary Contact)
- First*:
- Last*:
- Email*:
- Role*:
- Skills*:
- Favorite online profile (e.g., AngelList, LinkedIn, Google+, personal blog, Github, about.me, Twitter)*:
- Favorite brand*:
- Have you applied to PIE previously (either with this idea or with another one)?*

*PRO TIP: 	Please feel free to add additional founder profiles as necessary.*

There will be room for four founders on the official application. 
Only one founder is required.

### MORE TEAM
Now that you've provided details about each of the founders as individuals, we’d love to hear about how you work together as a team.
- Tell us a story. How did you team up?
- You've got geek cred, right? Prove it.
- We know you've screwed up before. Revel in it. Describe your most spectacular failure to date. 
- Link to something on the web that depicts your team dynamic. Be creative. This could be a video where you show us your team in action. Or it could be a session of layer tennis among team members. Or it could be a dribbble account. Or a screenshot of your latest IRC exchange. Or you could just treat us to something that already exists on the Web which captures your team dynamic. We, for example, when asked this question would probably just send you a link to Grumpy Cat or whaling (the human version, not the terrible Blackfish version) — or a bunch of Grumpy Cats whaling.  Did we mention “be creative”? 

### MISCELLANEOUS COMPANY CRAP
- Are you incorporated?
- Have you raised money? If so, how much?
- Are you currently raising? If so, how much?
- Have you been through another accelerator program?

### WHY PIE?
We like PIE a whole bunch. And we love expanding the PIE family. But we'd love to know why you think PIE is the right place for you.
- Well, why PIE?*
- Clearly, you’re going to be the next big thing. I mean, you’re kind of a big deal already. But why else should we pick you?
- One of the most crucial elements of PIE is the opportunity to work with other startups in your class to mutual benefit. We call it peer mentoring. Startups call it a support group. So what do you hope to bring to PIE to help everyone succeed?
- PIE has an added benefit of collaborating with Wieden+Kennedy — an agency recognized as one of the most creative in the world. That means, when we see an opportunity, we get to work together on projects. Does the prospect of collaborating with W+K excite you, frighten you, or is it just “meh”?
- Why?
- If you could pick one mentor—living or dead—who would it be? Why?
- Anything else we should know about you, your team, your product, or your amalgamated awesomeness?

### REFERENCES (optional)
PIE is a growing family of amazing companies, mentors, and investors. We look to this group to provide us with guidance on our selection process. So if you can name a PIE alum, mentor, or investor who will vouch for you, that can go a long way with us. A long, long way. 

*PRO TIP: 	Even though it’s optional, it’s very, very highly valued 
by the selection committee.*

… and you’re done! 

That wasn’t so bad was it? 

**NOTE: 	This is a rhetorical question. It is not a question on the 
official application.**
