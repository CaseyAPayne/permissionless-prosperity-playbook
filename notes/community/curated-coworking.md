# Curated coworking

Via @enam

	I am adding this because it applies to our venture of curated co-working, I am curious about the process you used for a curated co-working location (back when that described what you were). Our goal is one of high quality curated membership. 

	I imagine the topic of curation applies to the incubator situation as well and that many backers would be interested to get a window into the process for soliciting and vetting members/participants that you have found to be most successful.
