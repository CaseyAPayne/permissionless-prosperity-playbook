# Curated coworking

Via @enam

	I am adding this because it applies to our venture of curated co-working, I am curious about the process you used for a curated co-working location (back when that described what you were). Our goal is one of high quality curated membership. 

	I imagine the topic of curation applies to the incubator situation as well and that many backers would be interested to get a window into the process for soliciting and vetting members/participants that you have found to be most successful.

	Thanks for suggesting this! We definitely have plans to touch on that experiment in PIE's history but we'll make sure to be more explicit about how the curated coworking worked. I think the most important thing we learned is that coworking and community development, rather than being complementary, are often at odds with one another.
