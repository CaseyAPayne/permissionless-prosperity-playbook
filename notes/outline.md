2. About 
	3. Context
		4. Building an accelerator is not a means of creating a community from scratch. Building an accelerator is a means of capitalizing on community momentum and focusing it for the greatest benefit for that community.
		5. This is not just for tech. This is not just for startups. This is an educational construct to be applied and revised however best you see fit.

					11. Entrepreneurs and technologists are a new creative class, and their problem-solving toolkit will be increasingly important to solve the emerging brand challenges we tackle at Wieden+Kennedy. But words and images don’t always seem to play well with code. And folks great at one craft may not recognize another as “creative.” But in a world of distributed software and hardware, it’s important to find ways to work together. Entrepreneurs and technologists are inspired creatives who’ve chosen technology as their medium for creative expression. We should be able to find ways to do cool stuff, together.
