# Drawing inspiration from other chefs

There are a benefits to starting something after people have already tested the waters. You’re getting the chance to take advantage of learnings from predecessors to inform the organization you’re trying to build. 

We tried to do the same thing. But when we started thinking about PIE as an accelerator, we weren’t quite as lucky. Much like when we started the coworking space, there were few models from which to select—and none of them had proven whether the model would actually pencil out. (Many of them still haven’t.) 

So we just had to take our best guess from the available options. But unlike you with hundreds of successful accelerator programs from which to choose, we had, well, two. Those two models were still in their early existence but they made the most sense to us. And seemed most in line with what we were trying to accomplish. So we took a risk. And tried to glean as much as we could from what they were doing and apply those concepts to our program.

Now the names of our inspirational chefs — our Julia Child and James Beard as it were — aren’t going to be surprising to you, in this day and age. The two programs we chose to serve as role models were — now obvious thanks to their continued success — Y Combinator and TechStars. 

Things weren’t as obvious back then as they are today. There was little indication at that time that these two entities would become the juggernauts of startup acceleration that they are today. 

We just got lucky. 

Note: This is a recurring theme.

Looking back, we also made a decidedly important decision by accident. 

You see, we knew we couldn’t recreate the perceived effectiveness of either of those programs, wholesale. Because we didn’t have all of the necessary ingredients at our disposal. Nor were we in a region that would provide all of those elements. 

So rather than selecting one program after which to pattern ourselves in a cookie-cutter fashion we chose to instead dissect each program and take only the elements which we felt best resonated with our audience—and that we had a chance of effectively emulating.

That is, it did us no good to strive to set up the program up as the onramp to the Silicon Valley elite and a bevy of investors—because we didn’t have the access that would have enabled this. Instead, we took only the parts of each program we had the ingredients to effectively recreate. 

Kind of like borrowing a cup of sugar from your neighbor.
