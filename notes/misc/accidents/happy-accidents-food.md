# Food 
We learned to use food as a tool in our program because breaking bread with one another fosters a sense of community. 

When you feel engaged with your community, you are more likely to lean on them for support. It is our job as management to provide support for your companies, and support goes beyond the scope of business.  

It's important for management to take the metaphorical temperature of the program class from time to time and see if there is a need to provide stress relief. 

- Did folks have a slammed week of meetings?
- So much pitch practice they want to walk away from it all?  
- Tension between founders?  

The answer to all of these problems is food, at least on some level.  You’ll get more out of folks if you are able to empathize with them and take a breather every now and again. But we don’t just eat food, we make food together. We find time in the program to take a group cooking class, on one of the regularly scheduled family dinner nights, and we work together to create that night's meal.  

It's a real bonding experience and gives us an opportunity to connect on another level - a human level.
