# Homogenous mentors

When we started, we assumed that the best mentors for tech startup founders would be tech startup founders and only tech startup founders. This was flawed.

What we discovered was that a more diverse mentor community was needed. Successes, failure, founders, users, and more were needed. And that provided us with a far more beneficial mentor group than if they had all been expert.

But the experts were pretty awesome too.
