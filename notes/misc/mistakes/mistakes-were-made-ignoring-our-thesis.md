# Ignoring our thesis

It didn’t take long for us to discover that PIE was actually very good at one type of technology startup: 

> Business-to-Business platforms and enabling technology. 

We had the mentors to support it. We had the alums to help with the peer mentoring and connections. And we had a patron who was expert at succeeding as a behind-the-scenes partner for any number of brands.

In the world of venture capital and early stage startups, discovering a theme like this and defining it as a touchpoint for both how and with whom you do business is called a "thesis." And those investors who create and stick to a compelling thesis retain focus, thematically complementary companies in their portfolio, and a lens through which they assess every opportunity. 

It's just good business. Do what you know. Stick to what you know. Everyone wins.  

But despite our best efforts, we never did a good job of sticking to that thesis. We even got to the point of telling startups "We're not good at this. So please don't apply." But it didn't help. In fact, sometimes, that only made it worse.

And so we continually fell into the trap of going off-thesis. Granted, we hedged with “well this is an experiment” and “the market is constantly evolving.”

We were an accelerator that was good with business-to-business. It was exceedingly obvious. And yet what did we do with every single class? 

That’s right. We took on consumer facing technology as each class. Consistently. 

Was this good for them? Potentially. Was it good for us? Only in continuing to prove that we couldn't move the needle in that industry as much as we had hoped. 

Stick to your thesis. You'll be better for it. More importantly, so will you startups.
