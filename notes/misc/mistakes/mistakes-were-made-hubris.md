# Hubris

As the PIE accelerator garnered more recognition and our reputation grew, we fell into a very smug trap. 

With hundreds of applications flooding in the door from “every continent except Antarctica” and PIE landing in “Top Startup Accelerator” rankings around the Web, we lost sight of one of our key goals: to make it easier to build a startup in Portland. 

Or maybe we failed to put the words in the right order: to make it easier for Portland startups to build.

Extending our recruiting worldwide in an effort to garner an ever higher number of applications did nothing to change the dynamic of the program. And while it may have helped the perception that Portland was becoming a viable town for startups, it did little to impact the reality of building a business here.

What’s more, the numbers never really played out. 

Year after year, despite the amount of outreach and promotions, we always got around 400 applications for the PIE class. 

Now, one can argue that—in a world where a new accelerator launched every single day—static application numbers could be perceived as an upward trend. However, we can easily argue right back that for every accelerator started that day, 100 startups were started. 

Of those 400 applications, on average, 60% of them came from outside of Portland. Every year. No matter what we did.

By the time we made it through the selection process and made offers to companies, the number of founders who had come from outside of Portland—we often encountered cases where one founder lived in Portland and other founders chose to relocate—that 25% of PIE founders, class by class, came from outside the region.

And when class was over? The overwhelming majority of startups that relocated to Portland to participate in PIE relocated right back home when they were done.

Long story short, this worldwide focus was not providing any tangible impact on the Portland startup scene. Nor was it making it easier for Portland startups.

That hubris knocked us off track. And honestly, it took the concept of this book to get us back on track.

**Lesson learned: Don’t lose sight of your original goal.**
