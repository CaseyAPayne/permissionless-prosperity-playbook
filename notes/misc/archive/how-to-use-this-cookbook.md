# How to use this cookbook

Like many cookbooks, there’s no one way to use this book. But we have designed it with two particular use cases in mind:

1. If you are intrigued by the idea of starting an accelerator but have absolutely no idea where to start—or, worse yet, are paralyzed by a fear of failure that’s preventing you from taking the leap—this book will guide you step-by-step through the iterations that PIE followed, highlighting mistakes we made along the way and culminating with the process we use to run our accelerator today.  
2. If you have already started an accelerator but are feeling like you could be doing better, this book will allow you to jump to sections that apply to specific areas of your program that you’re looking to improve. 

Like any cookbook, this book provides the recipes that worked for PIE. They may or may not work for your organization. And your special adaptations are what make the recipe work for you. 

With that in mind, it is our intention to:

- Arm you with enough knowledge to be dangerous. And to break things.
- Give you enough insight into our process for you to internalize it, change it, and create your own way of doing things.
- Encourage you to communicate back to us what worked and what didn’t. So that we can create a more compelling cookbook for everyone that is just as crazy as we are.
