# README.md
We'll use this section to capture notes as we're brainstorming about a certain topic â€” and potentially other spots throughout the development of the documentation.

It's just one big parking lot. 

To prevent any confusion with versioning, any content from this section that has already moved downstream to the document, itself, will be captured in the /archive directory under each topic.

NOTE: This may result in different iterations of the same concept appearing in multiple files over time. We will normalize this as the content moves downstream into the final documentation.
