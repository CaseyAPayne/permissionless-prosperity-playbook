> It's hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the time. I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because we ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the very beginning. But as the summer progressed we were increasingly impressed by how well the startups were doing.… When people came to YC to speak at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone coming to address a Boy Scout troop. By the time they left the building they were all saying some variant of "Wow, these companies might actually succeed."

> - Paul Graham, [How Y Combinator Started](http://old.ycombinator.com/start.html)

This cookbook all began simply enough. As a way of formalizing the mechanics and processes of the PIE program. In case one of us, as the euphemism goes, got hit by a bus.

But once we started working on it. And building it out. We realized that we were actually beginning to scratch the surface of something much larger. Something far more compelling. 

What we had hit upon — unbeknownst to us at the time — was a framework for anyone, anywhere to start building a startup accelerator. 

Or, perhaps even more generically, a way for people to accelerate creative output. 

As with framework, we were curious as to whether what we had built would have value for others. Was it repeatable? Where were our blind spots? Could others improve upon our initial learnings? Suffice it to say, we had tons of questions. 

So drawing on our Portland open source roots, we began to think of this as something bigger than PIE. And what better way to enable folks from all communities to join us in taking on that challenge than to open source the document? An open invitation for others to provide feedback and insights for the greater good. And a starting point — a baseline — from which we could continue to iterate, test, and revise much as we would with any startup. Or experiment. 

Because the best thing about experiments is that whether you succeed or fail you always, always, always learn something.

Welcome to the PIE Cookbook.

## Caveats

I have always been a fan of books that start with a caveat or two. Because inevitably, you, gentle reader, have just started down this path. And given that you've already started to get a feel for where this is going, you're inevitably jumping to the question: Is this book for me?

The answer is yes. But with a few caveats.

1. **This is not a problem technology can solve**. If technology could solve this problem, we would have built it. Trust us. But it can't. This isn't about algorithms or dynamically connecting dots. This is about getting to know people. And what makes them tick. And what pisses them off. And what scares them. This is about seeing non-obvious connections. It is about using what artists refer to as "negative space." Finding opportunity in what is absent or invisible.   
  
> Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.  
  
> The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The Japanese word "ma" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in garden design.  
  
> - ["Negative space" in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space)  
  
So if you're looking for a way to throw technology at the problem and avoid the messy feels and stuff, it's probably best to stop reading here and starting searching the web for what you think you need.

2. **This is not a scalable solution**. This is the very reason we're not seeking to stamp out a ton of cookie cutter versions of PIE. Because our way of doing this doesn't scale. Well, that and "cookie cutter" and "PIE" is a mixed metaphor. We don't believe you can recreate what we created to solve Portland, Oregon's technology startup problem late in the first decade of this century. Nor would we want you to.     
  
It's not that we haven't tried. We have. But each time, it comes out differently. Because the community the each accelerator model supports needs it to be different. 

3. **This is not an efficient solution**. Given the first two caveats, it is appropriate to assume the third — and potentially most obvious — caveat, that one of how time consuming this is. It doesn't scale. There are no technology shortcuts. It takes time. But none of it is wasted. Even if you're making mistakes. Because it is through that process of trying, iterating, changing, and learning that you will manage to build the best accelerator for your community — no matter what that community happens to be.

## Format

We’ve structured this as a cookbook for an accelerator. And admittedly, we may have been a little heavy handed with that whole analogy. Sorry. That’s just how we roll. But you’ll get used to it. 

At least, we’re not subjecting you to the endless stream of idiotic pie related puns we bandy about on a daily basis. So be thankful for that. 

Besides, it seemed to be a really compelling way to get you from the first taste of an accelerator to, well, dessert. 

And honestly, when it comes right down to it? You’ll quickly realize that every founder has the exact same personality traits as a temperamental chef. Obsessed with perfection. Driven to succeed. Shouldering the brunt of every criticism no matter how seemingly minute.

And loving what they do. Not matter how hard and painful it is to foster the creation of something amazing.  

One of the most important headings you’ll find throughout the cookbook will be labeled “Mistakes were made.” This is where PIE screwed up, tripped, or outright failed. Why is this critical? Because you can follow the recipe word for word and never accurately recreate PIE. But you can always learn from our mistakes.

You’ll also see sections labeled “Happy accidents.” These are times where we tried something random or accidentally discovered a benefit through absolutely no planning whatsoever. It just sort of happened. Salt fell in the pot and it just tasted better. And it helped. And hopefully it will help you. And inspire you to take random risks of your own.

Finally, we’ll do our best to share all of the ingredients, preparations, step-by-step instructions, and intended results of these recipes. And if we don’t do that terribly well? Tell us. And we’ll fix it. For everyone. 

Note: Your flavors of PIE will vary. In fact, they must vary. If they don’t, you’re likely doing it wrong.

## Building a studio

When it comes right down to it, all we’ve done at PIE is figure out a way to create a protected and trusted environment for creative people to try new things — and potentially fail. It’s like any artist’s studio. 

## PIE as an example

Throughout this book, you’ll find us using PIE as an example. I mean, I guess it makes sense. It’s the accelerator we know best. But please keep in mind that references to PIE are meant to serve as that and only that. An example. 

It’s not doctrine. Or a specific recipe. Or maybe even the right way to do things. In fact, we’ll highlight—on any number of occasions—how it was absolutely not the right way to do things.

Please don’t think that we’re purporting to have the only recipe for an accelerator. Because we don’t. And if that’s what you’re hoping to get out of this book, then you should probably stop reading right now.

Because there are plenty of ways for you to start an accelerator based solely on someone else’s model. And there are any number of successful accelerators that have programs to help you do this. There are also any number of curricula available for purchase that will arm you to deliver their prescribed way of learning.

And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with taking those paths to an accelerator. For many, that is the only viable way of effectively achieving the goals they are trying to meet. 

But that’s not what this book is designed to do. Far from it.

What this book is designed to do is quite simple. We’re going to teach you to fish.

We simply wanted to provide some contextual evidence for our learnings at PIE, the majority of which will be purely anecdotal. This is a conceit to bring our theoretical guidance into more tactical applications. And to prove to you that we screwed up a lot, made a ton of mistakes, and got lucky in any number of ways. 

And it’s important to note that we have realized these concepts not only in the context of early stage technology startups. Yes, we’ve spent the majority of our time and learning applying these techniques to early stage tech startups. But we’ve also experimented with these techniques on nonprofits, open source projects, and solo founders. We’ve applied these techniques to more traditional creative pursuits. We’ve even had opportunities to test these processes on internal employee teams as a means of driving innovation throughout large corporations. 

Long story short, there are any number of ways to apply the concepts of trust, pressure, and mentorship to any number of creative pursuits. To accelerate creative output. 

But our context for this experimentation has always been PIE. And in order for PIE to make sense as a point of reference, you need to understand a little bit of the history of the organization. And also recognize that, much like you, we started by simply taking what others were doing, using that as a framework for something different, and iterating from there. 

While we’ll get into specific elements of the program, its composition, and its multiple iterations throughout the book, here is some grounding in where this whole thing started.
