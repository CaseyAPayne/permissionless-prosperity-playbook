# Definitions

We feel that it is extremely important to have a consistent set of language to describe the concepts and participants in this process. Without clear definitions, we run the risk of miscommunication — even when we think that we’re speaking the same language.

For that reason, we're going to provide you with some definitions of terms that are regularly used throughout the PIE Cookbook. Please note that, like all things in this document, we are simply providing this as a reference. We would encourage you to create your own set of definitions for your specific needs.

## Community
Community can refer to any group of individuals who hold common goals and are motivated to collaborate to achieve those goals. There is no specified size for a community. And communities can be nested within other communities — or overlap. Therefore, it is always important to test the assumptions of toward what the "community" is working.

> e.g., The Portland technology community has subsets like the Portland open source community and the Portland tech startup community. There is significant crossover between the open source community and the tech startup community, but they do not share exactly the same goals.

A community simply has to have a focus. It can revolve around concepts, ideals, goals, brands, or any combination thereof. We see community, at its essence, as a group of people with a shared, collaborative vision.

## Incubator
An incubator is a protected work environment designed to shelter founders and ideas as they work to realize concepts and prototypes. Incubators are designed to help early stage ideas survive longer than they would in the wild, independent of shelter. As such, an incubator does not accurately reflect the stressors and turmoil of the real world. Instead, it seeks to shield founders from reality by providing resources that best ensure its likelihood of finding commercial applications of its concept(s). This is by design.

> e.g., University tech transfer programs tend to be a good example of incubators

Although PIE has "incubator" in its name, that's a misnomer. We simply couldn't come up with a phrase that worked for PAELLA.
