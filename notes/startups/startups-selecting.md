# Selection criteria for startups

One of the most commonly asked questions about PIE is how we select the startups which participate in the program. 

Once they've completed the written application, submitted responses to our follow-up questions, and successfully completed a face-to-face interview, we weigh the following criteria to determine who we will invite to participate in the class.

Of course, it's an acronym. And it's another flavor of PIE.

## People

If we've encountered one glaring misconception, time and time again, it's that accelerators should choose companies based on their idea or product. We couldn't disagree more.

While product is an important part of the recipe for a successful company, of far more import is the team. The people involved in the effort. 

So our primary selection criteria is simple. It's people.

Now, people is a messy thing. It's full of qualitative analysis. And gut feeling. And personality. And charm. And it's less about figuring out if the accelerator will be successful with the founders and more about figuring out if the founders have the ability to learn and grown within the accelerator environment.

As a side note, you'll notice we talk about "founders" throughout this section, rather than solo founders. We've run some PIE experiments with solo founders and — with rare exception — we would suggest steering clear of those folks in the accelerator environment.

1. First and foremost, founders much be coachable.
2. Founders must respect one another's areas of expertise and roles.
3. Founders must be willing to engage with their peers.
