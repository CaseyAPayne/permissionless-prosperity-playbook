# Educating startups

Startups will only internalize information when they are prepared to hear it. To put it another way, you could put the foremost expert in situation X in front of one of your startups. If the founder is currently dealing with situation Y, believes the company has already dealt with situation X, or is naive that situation X is something that even occurs, then pairing those two is a mistake. 

Startups only pay attention to the situation in which they find themselves at that very moment. Itâ€™s like a full kitchen at the height of dinner rush. Make sure nothing is burning. Taste the food before it goes out. Make sure customers are happy. It does absolutely no good to discuss flavor profiles with the chef when he or she is busy breaking down the protein to get it on the heat. 

Putting mentors in front of startups that are not ready to listen is a recipe for complete failure. The founder will not hear a thing. The mentor will be frustrated and potentially feel as if his or her time has been wasted.
