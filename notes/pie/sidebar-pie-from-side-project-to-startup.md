… So we continued to function as a coworking space. And to build our alumni network. And the collaborative atmosphere of PIE took a back seat to ensuring that people had desks and we were hosting events and whatnot.

Oh. And bear in mind, that this is still just a side project for everyone involved.

So we’ve got companies renting desks at PIE, growing quickly, and then leaving to make room for new companies. And we’ve got some companies who’ve been at PIE for awhile. Long enough to remember the old days. And we’ve got alums doing amazing things and landing more funding.

And then there was this interesting dynamic happening upstairs.

You see, it turns out W+K was making some phenomenal hires. Folks who understood online. And who knew mobile. And who got the whole tech thing. I mean, really got it. Folks who were stronger and more thoughtful than many of the folks at PIE. And who got to focus on that kind of thinking full time. Not just as an aspect of their startup.

And so, PIE began to wane as a think tank, as well.

Should PIE stay or should PIE go?

So the beginning of 2011 rolls around. And the cofounders have to sit down with W+K management to discuss what’s been happening with PIE. Because, let’s face it. It’s still Renny and W+K’s experiment. We were just serving as the willing lab rats.

And I’ll have to admit, it was one of those stomach churning, nail biting, sweat inducing meetings.

We were walking into the meeting knowing full well that we had failed to meet the original objectives of PIE. We hadn’t really created any new products—other than the startups we had launched. We hadn’t hit upon a new revelation in platforms that multiple W+K clients would find helpful. We hadn’t really ever gelled as a think tank for the account teams.

Fail. Fail. Fail.

So tail between our legs, we walked into the meeting. Expecting to leave with boxes for cleaning off our desks. Expecting that we would be looking for somewhere new to sit. Or heading back to our home offices and coffee shops.

But that’s not what happened.

Oh I mean sure, we discussed what abject failures we were at meeting our intended goals of the original experiment. And how we had failed to release any meaningful work as a collective. Don’t get me wrong. We reveled in that for a while.

But then, the discussion turned to what had actually happened. And where we had succeeded. Succeeded beyond our expectations.

Mentoring and accelerating.

You see, organically and largely through serendipity we had managed to create a space that had become a hub of activity and intelligent people. A space that was capable of making connections, providing guidance, and accelerating companies. Helping startups get their footing, find funding, and hire people more rapidly than they would have without PIE. Helping them find their way. Helping them make it.

Really, just mentoring them.

And so that’s where W+K asked us to focus. Not on fixing where we had failed. But on putting more momentum behind where we were succeeding. They asked PIE to become a full fledged mentoring resource. To help accelerate and incubate companies.

And it turns out, Renny offered, that they had some folks who would help us in that regard: Wieden+Kennedy’s customers.

PIE 2.0
And so we’ve embarked on the next stage of the experiment. The next version of PIE.
It’s an incubator fashioned after the TechStars model. We provide space, mentorship, and a small stipend in exchange for an equity stake in the companies who participate.
And we’re hoping to work with folks from TechStars, Y Combinator, 500 Startups, and any number of other organizations focused on helping startups succeed.

We just want to see startups make it.

We’ll be running the incubator with amazing people from the Portland tech community, the broader tech community, and well-known brands like Target, Coca-Cola, and Nike.

And we’ll be working to find awesome startups—either within Portland or without—to come spend three months us at PIE, building their dreams into going concerns. Maybe they’ll get funding. Maybe they’ll stand up on their own. Maybe they’ll be acquired. Maybe they’ll just be ready to step into Y Combinator or TechStars or the Portland Seed Fund.

We just want them to make it. To move from side project to startup. And to focus on building good solid companies.

And yes. I keep saying “we.” That’s the side story. I’m happy to announce that I’ll be working on PIE full time. That’s right. My side project has become my startup. And like Silicon Florist, it’s a startup designed to help startups. I can’t wait to see where this goes. And I’m sincerely hoping you’ll take the chance to join me.

Don’t worry. I’ll still keep posting my drivel here. Highlighting the awesome startups in Portland and what they’re accomplishing. And we’ll still be more than happy to host hackathons and gatherings and celebrations for the Portland tech community. And hopefully more.

You can’t get away from me that easily, silly.
