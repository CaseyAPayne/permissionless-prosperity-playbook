We thought there was something there. And potential for Portland.

Hold that thought.

Along about the same time, Renny Gleeson over at W+K was pitching a similar idea to the folks at Wieden. He was dreaming of something that would connect W+K with the Portland tech community. Something that would help W+K stay in touch with the latest tech developments and would help the Portland tech community thrive.

And W+K just so happened to have a retail space in its building—sitting empty—that could serve as the perfect location for this sort of thing.

And that led to one of those serendipitous Portland moments when James Keller—who had worked with Renny before leaving W+K to form Small Society—suggested Renny bounce his idea off of some the tech types in town.

I guess everyone else was busy. Because he decided to chat with me.

As he laid out the idea and my eyes got wider and wider, we happened upon what can only be categorized as a Reese’s “you got your creative chocolate in my startup peanut butter” moment.
