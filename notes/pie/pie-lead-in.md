The PIE accelerator, unbeknownst to us, started in 1995, 15 years before PIE officially became an accelerator.

It doesn't have to take that long for your community. But it did for ours.

This isn't a guide. Or a regimen. This isn't the answer. This is simply how PIE became an accelerator. There is no right timespan for this. For some communities, it happens more quickly and organically. For others, it takes a long, long, long time.

I would argue that, in many ways, we're not done. And an accelerator might not be the final answer. And we're still working toward even becoming something truly valuable and sustainable.

So with that in mindâ€¦
