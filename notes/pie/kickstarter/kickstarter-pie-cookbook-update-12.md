# Stretch Goal 3.14: Let’s get cooking

Howdy Kickstarter types!

Hope you’re doing well. Our community around this project keeps growing with awesome people from all over the world. To keep it going, we’ve just created another stretch goal focused on getting even more awesome folks involved.

As we’ve said a few times, we’re more interested in community than capital. So just like Stretch Goal 1 and Stretch Goal 1.1 — get 100 people from your community to back (even if it’s just $1) and PIE will come visit your town, in person — we’re using this stretch goal to encourage even more people to join this project.

(Speaking of Stretch Goal 1.1, the folks in London are rallying support in their community (https://twitter.com/macfarbt/status/709842287178686467). We’re hoping your community can do the same. We're really looking forward to meeting with a bunch of awesome startup communities out there.)

So here it goes…

We’ve said from the outset that we’re pursuing this project whether it’s funded or not. Well, it’s currently funded and it looks like this project should complete successfully in a couple of weeks. So what are we waiting for? We should get cooking.

If we can hit 314 backers, we’ll do just that. Once the Kickstarter backer counter reaches 314 people — regardless of the amount raised — we’ll open up our Github repository so you can start following the project. And we’ll invite every PIE Cookbook backer to join our new PIE Cookbook Slack instance so that you can start collaborating with us — and 314+ of your startup accelerator peers — in real time, before anyone else gets the chance to join.

Tell your colleagues, friends, and community members. Once we get to 314 backers, we’re kicking off the project. And we can all get cooking, sooner rather than later.
