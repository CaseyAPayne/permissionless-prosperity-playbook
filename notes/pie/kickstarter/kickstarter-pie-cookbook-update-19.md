# Another learning opportunity: 500 Startups Venture Capital Unlocked: Accelerator edition

Howdy backers!

Given your curiosity about startup accelerators, we thought this offer from our friends at 500 Startups might be of interest to you, as well. It's the [500 Startups Venture Capital Unlocked: Accelerator edition](http://500.co/announcing-vc-unlocked-accelerator-edition/).

> In Venture Capital Unlocked: Accelerator edition, current and aspiring accelerator managers will take a 1 week deep dive into everything it takes to start and run a successful program.

> It will be taught by 500 founding partners Christine Tsai and Dave McClure, along with managing partner Bedy Yang and various investment partners involved in running 500â€™s accelerator (Marvin Liao, Elizabeth Yin, Sean Percival and many others). They will offer an inside look at the 500 Startups accelerator playbook for the first time.

If you're interested, here's the preliminary agenda for the week-long bootcamp.

P.S. We still have a few days to go on the PIE Cookbook campaign. So please tell your friends. We're still hoping to add some more awesome towns to our road trip!
