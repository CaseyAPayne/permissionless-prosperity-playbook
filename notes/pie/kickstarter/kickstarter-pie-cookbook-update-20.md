# What's working in startup acceleration?

Howdy!

We wanted to make sure that folks saw a recent report from the Global Accelerator Learning Initiative. The report, entitled "Whatâ€™s Working in Startup Acceleration Insights from Fifteen Village Capital Programs," details specific impacts of accelerator programs and predicts what's to come in the world of accelerators.

> Ultimately, this report aims to provide accelerator program managers and funders with practical lessons and insights to consider for their own programs, based on the experiences and analysis of these fifteen Village Capital programs. Through this and other research efforts, we hope to stimulate more evidence-based learning and practice improvements in the entrepreneurial acceleration sector.

Hope that helps,
