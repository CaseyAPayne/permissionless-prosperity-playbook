# Stretch Goal #2: Help us celebrate Pi Day by helping nonprofit Caldera

Part of the appeal of Kickstarter is the looming deadline. Racing against the clock. Can your favorite project raise the funds it needs to become a reality — before time runs out?

Well that got us to thinking… what if stretch goals worked the same way?

With that in mind, Stretch Goal #2 will end when Pi Day — March 14… you know, 3.14 — ends. It’s a campaign within a campaign. The goal? We’re going to be donating all proceeds (minus the cost of producing and shipping your selected reward) raised during Pi Day to one of our favorite nonprofits, [Caldera](http://calderaarts.org/).

Not familiar with Caldera? They believe in the power of creativity — and its ability to change lives.

> Caldera’s mission is to be a catalyst for the transformation of underserved youth through innovative, year-round art and environmental programs.

> Focusing on youth from both urban and rural communities with limited access to educational, economic, and physical resource opportunities, Caldera nurtures individual creativity to ignite self-expression and transform the way young people engage in their lives, families, and communities.

What inspired us to raise money for Caldera? We’re harkening back to one of PIE’s earliest experiments, 30 Hour Day, the first ever 30 hour livestreamed telethon — hosted at PIE — that helped raise money for local charities. During those 30 hours, we managed to raise nearly $10,000 in cash, food, and toys. We’re sincerely hoping we can do something equally meaningful for Caldera.

There’s no better day to back the PIE Cookbook given that your dollar earns you a vote, moves your community one step closer to Stretch Goal #1, and ultimately helps a great cause like Caldera.

Everybody wins. And we and Caldera greatly appreciate your generosity.

Happy Pi Day! 
Renny and Rick

P.S. If you would like all of your funds to go to Caldera, we suggest skipping the socks, hats, and shirts, and backing the project at $3.14 — or your preferred dollar amount.
