# Closeout sale: We’re slashing 33% off of our Stretch Goal

The past month has been amazing! So many great people. And we've been completely humbled by the outpouring of support. 

But as much as we hate to admit it, our time here on Kickstarter is winding down. We’ve only got about a week to go. But we’ve still got a warehouse full of Stretch Goals. And these Stretch Goals aren’t going to stretch themselves.

But get ready to be happy. Because our loss is your gain. Act now and you and your startup community can get these brand new, full featured Stretch Goals… at a fraction of the original Stretch Goal number.

We’re talking specifically about Stretch Goal 1. You know, the Stretch Goal that gets PIE cofounders Renny and Rick to travel to your town once you hit 100 backers — even if those backers only contribute $1 each? 

Admittedly, that stretch goal may have been a bit of a stretch. But we’d still love nothing more than to come visit you. So since it's the last week of the campaign, we're going to make that Stretch Goal better than ever. 

How? By slashing that Stretch Goal by 33%. 

That’s right! Now any town that gets 66 backers — at any level — will be getting an in person visit from PIE. Not possible? Tell that to the awesome startup community in Eugene, Oregon. They've already exceeded that Stretch Goal and secured an in-person visit from PIE. And we know that your community can too! (NOTE: The discounted Stretch Goal of 66 backers guarantees an in-person visit from Renny or Rick. It’s discounted, after all. Renny and Rick are still guaranteed for 100+ backer towns.)

But wait! There’s more! Back the project today. Hit Stretch Goal 1 with 66 backers… and we’ll throw in Stretch Goal 1.1 at no extra charge. It’s like hitting two Stretch Goals for fewer people than one.

Act now! This deal won’t last forever. (Seriously, I mean, the campaign ends on April 1, 2016.)

We’d love to come visit you and your awesome startup community.  So just get 66 backers — at any amount — and PIE will visit your town.
