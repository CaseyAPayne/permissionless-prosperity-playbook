# New backer reward level added

As we work to build up this community of awesome folks, we're always looking for ways to encourage more people to participate. And collaborate. Sometimes it's just cajoling. And sometimes it's proposing interesting stretch goals. But the tried and true method is solid backer rewards.

With that in mind, we wanted to let you know that we've added a new backer reward level, "Fill up on Portland tech." Backing at that $75 reward level will secure you one ticket to TechfestNW, the annual Portland tech event that PIE helped cofound, being held April 25-26, 2016, in beautiful Portland, Oregon.

But you better act fast. Supplies are limited.
