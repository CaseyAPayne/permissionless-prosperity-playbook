Oregon performs a biennial "capital scan" both to determine the impact of investment in the region and to identify opportunities and gaps for future investment. This year's capital scan identified the following as the primary opportunity for the region:

> #1: Invest in the foundational building blocks of the company formation ecosystem: entrepreneurial support organizations, accelerators, co-working spaces and the communities that form around them; the seeds that create viable returns/mission-aligned investment opportunities. 

If you're thinking about building an accelerator, we thought the findings in the latest capital scan would be valuable to you â€” whether you live in the Pacific Northwest United States or not.
