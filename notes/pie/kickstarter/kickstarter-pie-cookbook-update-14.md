# No interest in building a startup accelerator like PIE? Good.

We've been chatting with lots of folks about the PIE Cookbook. Including discussing our motivations for open sourcing the document and encouraging others to start accelerators. 

And while those conversations have been awesome — one on one — it's become painfully obvious that we haven't done such a good job of broadly conveying those themes. To solve that, [we thought that jotting down some of our thoughts might be helpful](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/no-interest-in-building-a-startup-accelerator-like-pie-good-f31ecbd14e05#.491zrsk8t).

> With that in mind, please don’t try to recreate PIE. In fact, we would hate for you to bake our flavor of PIE. This isn’t a sleeve of prepared cookie dough that you halfheartedly slice onto a cookie sheet. This is a “Bake your own” proposition. 

> This is a recipe. And everyone has their own unique ingredients. This is about rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands in the mix. Making the recipe yours. Experimenting, manipulating, iterating, exploring, and improving. 

The world needs more variety — not less. And together, we all get better.
