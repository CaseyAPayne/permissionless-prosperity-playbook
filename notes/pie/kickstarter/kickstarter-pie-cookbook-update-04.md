# What about your accelerator project is keeping you up at night?

With all of the political discourse on social, we got to thinking about running an exit poll or two of our own. Don't worry. It's not about candidates. It's about something that's near and dear to our startup accelerator hearts. 

The question? If you're thinking about building a startup accelerator, what's keeping you up at night?

[As far as Twitter goes, early indicators are that funding is the biggest question mark for many folks](https://twitter.com/piepdx/status/705076716390100992). Are you feeling the same way? 

We're looking forward to answering questions about how to fund accelerator activity — and who you should ask — in the PIE Cookbook. So if that's important to you, make sure to use your votes to pick that topic as one of the first subjects we cover. 

More soon!

Take care,
Rick
