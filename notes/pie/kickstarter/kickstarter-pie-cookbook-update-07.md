# Stretch goal #1: Chats, hangouts, and meet ups… oh my!

You knew it was coming. It’s almost like a Kickstarter tradition or something. That’s right! It’s time for stretch goals.

But you know us. This is an experiment. We’ve got to do this… differently.

As we said, this isn’t about holding your feet to the fire. And this isn’t about the dollar total.It’s about the number of backers. It's about building community.

Because the more varied the voices? The more valuable the PIE Cookbook becomes. And the more diverse the questions? The more likely we are to enable more people to help startups. And the more people who believe in the power of accelerators? The more potential to have the kinds of accelerators we all want — and need — to further our chosen creative pursuits. Tech, art, design, employees, food, beverage, writing, apparel, culture, students… whatever.

It’s about collaborating. It’s about building a collection of best practices that can help anyone, anywhere accelerate anything. And it's about celebrating communities that want to support their founders, startups, mentors, and investors. Communities that want to embrace opportunities. Communities that want to provide their members with the greatest chances of success. Whether they want to build an accelerator or not. 

With that in mind, our stretch goals aren’t going to be based on getting more money. They’re going to be based on getting more people involved.

## Our goal is people… it’s people!

That's right. We're after something money can't buy. We want the chance to meet — and hopefully spend time with — your startup community. 

With that in mind, here’s the pitch for our first Stretch Goal:

- If your town gets 25 backers — as ranked by Kickstarter’s community metrics for this project — we’re inviting all of you to a 90 minute Slack chat about your startup scene. What’s that? Yes. You're correct. To have that chat, that would mean that you would get access to the PIE Cookbook Slack. And your very own #town channel. NOTE: We will not name the channel #town. We’ll actually name it for your town.
- If your town gets 50 backers, we’ll get even more personal by inviting all of you to a 90 minute Google Hangout so we can talk through your most pressing questions and most immediate opportunities for helping startups. Plus, you'll get access to the PIE Cookbook Slack with a channel for your town.
- If your town gets 100 backers, there’s no “virtual” about it. We’re coming to visit you in person so we can experience your amazing startup scene face-to-face. And, of course, you’ll also get access to the PIE Cookbook Slack and a channel for your town.

Wait what? Yep. You heard that right. If your town boasts 100 or more backers for this project, that’s exactly the kind of town we want to visit. PIE cofounders Renny Gleeson and Rick Turoczy will travel to you. So we can hang out with your community. And discuss accelerators, startups, and whatnot, in person.

When do we meet? It’s your community. You tell us. It can be early morning, midday, happy hour… whenever. It’s whatever works for the culture of your community. Maybe you’re a brunch town like Portland. Maybe you’re more an evening get-together sort of place. Maybe happy hours are your thing. Whatever works for you.

So gather 25 of your peers and we’ll all jump in Slack. If your town has 50 people backing the project, we’ll host a Google Hangout to chat with one another. And if you get 100 people from your awesome startup community to back the project, we’ll travel to you. To hang out. And to chat face-to-face.

How close is your town to hitting the stretch goal? We'll keep everyone up-to-date but you can always [check the community metrics for the PIE Cookbook campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/turoczy/pie-cookbook-an-open-source-guide-for-startup-acce/community).

No dollar goal. No stretch funding goal. Just people. Whether folks back at the $1 level or contribute something more, we'll count them all equally. It doesn’t matter how much money your community contributes to the project. It simply matters how many people from your community participate in the PIE Cookbook Kickstarter campaign. (That said, the tshirts are pretty nice.)

Ahem.

Let’s expand the PIE Cookbook community. Let's hang out with your community. And if you happen to get all of your peers, mentors, and startups involved? We are so there. In person. With all of our awful PIE puns.
