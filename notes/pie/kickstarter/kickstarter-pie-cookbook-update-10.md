# We're stretching our first stretch goal: Upgrading to Stretch goal #1.1

After we launched our first stretch goal for this project, I got feedback from a personal mentor of mine, Joe Maruschak. (Joe is a huge contributor to the Eugene, Oregon, startup community, working tirelessly on efforts like RAIN, among numerous other things.)

He liked where PIE was going with the stretch goal idea. But he had some feedback that would enable us to make that stretch goal even better. (And luckily, we were in Slack, so we were able to capture all of his awesome feedback.) 

So we’re implementing that. Immediately.

For context, our first stretch goal was that PIE will travel to meet with any community that gets 100 people to back the PIE Cookbook — even if they’re all $1 backers.

Now, we're stretching Stretch goal #1. Upgrading it, if you will, to Stretch goal #1.1. (Yes, stretching a stretch goal is meta. We're an accelerator for accelerators. What do you expect?)

So now, if your community can round up 100 backers, we’ll come visit your community in person plus…

- Your community will get a special PIE tchotchke, available only to towns that reach 100 backers.
- We’ll keep track of your community's progress and use PIE’s resources to raise the visibility of all of the awesome things happening in your community.
- We’ll work to connect the dots among all of the amazing leaders in your communities to ensure you will always have access to the best and brightest from the world of accelerators.
- While we're in town, we'll meet with community leaders — be they business, investment, economic development, government, higher education, or otherwise — to answer questions and provide context for the community benefits of the accelerator model.
- We’ll highlight your community as an example in the PIE Cookbook, itself, and update the content with your progress as time goes on.

Sound good? Good. So get on that. You’ve got a community to activate. And we’ll look forward to seeing you and your awesome community in person, soon.
