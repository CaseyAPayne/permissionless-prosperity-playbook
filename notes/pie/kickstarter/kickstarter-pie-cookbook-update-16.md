# Eugene and Corvallis at it again, and now, London calling

For those of you in the Pacific Northwest, news of Eugene and Corvallis competing with one another will be no surprise. (For those of you who aren't… Eugene, home of the University of Oregon, and Corvallis, home of Oregon State University, have an ongoing rivalry that spans more than a century.) We just didn't expect that rivalry to flare up around our little old project. But if that means we get to meet more awesome startup types, so be it!

For those of you keeping score at home, Eugene is edging ever closer to the century mark in backers, meaning that PIE gets to come visit. Corvallis has almost unlocked the Slack chat stretch goal. 

In related news… Today, London entered the fray, posting a call to rally backers and get the PIE crew on the other side of the pond. They've already arranged with coworking space WeWork Chancery Lane to host. 

It's not too late to get your community involved. Remember, all it takes is 100 backers. Even if those backers only contribute one dollar each. (100 x $1 = PIE) You heard that correctly. One hundred backers and PIE cofounders Renny and Rick will come visit your town to help your startup community however we can. 

We'd love an excuse to come visit you!

*REMINDER: Since we're over 314 backers, the PIE Cookbook repository is open on Github. And the PIE Cookbook Slack is now open for business. Just drop us a note with your preferred email address and we'll get you invited.*
