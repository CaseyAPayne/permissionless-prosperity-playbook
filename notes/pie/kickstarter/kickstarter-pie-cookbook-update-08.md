# PIE cofounder Renny Gleeson on why he's excited about the PIE Cookbook

I think we could publish, all day every day, on why we're excited about this project. But we'll try to keep it under control. I mean, if you want more, [we're more than happy to sit down and chat with you about it](http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=c5424c73e2781898d4f179b85&id=f12f27d122). 

In the meantime, here's the latest from Renny Gleeson, cofounder of PIE, on why he's excited about the PIE Cookbook project:

> In the evolving, tech-fueled innovation space, brands need more tools than just a checkbook to thrive. Don’t just buy innovation, build it. …

> The PIE Cookbook is an open-source, organically-grown, Kickstarted set of actionable insights and principles to help anyone accelerate anything they want. We are inviting our broader innovation community (old and new) to help us make accelerating great ideas a little less hard. It’s a toolset to enable brands to get more out of the accelerator format. More learning. More innovation. More collaboration. More community.
