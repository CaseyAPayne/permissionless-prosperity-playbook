# Unnecessarily proprietary

Howdy folks,

I'm still floored by this. We only just completed 24 hours of being live and the response has been incredibly humbling. Thank you SO much!

In that light, I wanted to share a bit more. It's hard to capture, in words, what this campaign means to PIE. And what it means to me personally. But I tried. And it wound up being a lot of words. A. LOT.

I won't subject you to my tortured prose, here. But if you're curious about some of the thinking and inspiration behind this project, please take a look at "[Unnecessarily proprietary: Why I'm insanely excited to open source our learnings from PIE](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.mv49oquej)."

More soon! 

Take care,
Rick
