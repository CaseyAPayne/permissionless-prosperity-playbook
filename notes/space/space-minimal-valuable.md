# Create a Minimally Valuable Space

We've noticed a tendency in the industry to deck out your coworking or shared workspace with the latest and greatest. Swanky furniture. Gaming equipment. Tons of outlets. Sit/stand desks. Comfy office chairs.

Yes, people ooh and ah when they see the space. Yes, it makes it easy to defend the prices you're charging them for space. And yes, it provides a certain sense of pride for the folks running the space. 

But, to be honest, more often than not, those are false positives. They don't really make for a great community space. 

Don't feel guilty. PIE fell for this trap too. Our initial build out was set design to be the quintessential startup workspace. Complete with closet door and sawhorse desks. 

It didn't work.

What we've learned over the years is that the space must be viable and functional. Aside from that, it should never be comfortable. It should never be easy. The space should be just difficult enough. Without being frustrating. 

It's not that we couldn't make the space more comfortable. It's that it shouldn't be more comfortable. The space, like building a startup, should be difficult. And awkward. It should always cause friction. And discomfort.

Your only requirements are a solid wifi connection, access to power, a surface for a laptop, and a chair. That's it. Beyond that, you provide less than is needed. 

Think less office space, more coffeeshop or bar.

You should have too many people in the space. It should be noisy. You should have too few conference rooms. People should be eavesdropping whether they want to or not. You should have passible coffee and, if it fits your culture, beer. And most of all, everyone should be in one another's way.

Why put the startups through additional stress and turmoil? Because your objective is not to coddle startups. If you want to coddle them, then start an incubator. Protect them with warmth and comfort. Shield them from the outside world. Create a utopian existence for them. That's what an incubator should do.

Your job as an accelerator, however, is to get them moving further faster than they would on their own. Your job is to get them to grow up and out. Your job is to create a microcosm. A biome of startup life. They same way it exists in the real world. But with a few safety nets strewn here and there.

And then you need to poke the startups so that, from time to time, they tumble into those safety nets.

If you provide a space that is too comfortable and too accommodating then the startups will stay there. Forever. And that isn't what you want. You want churn. You want growth. You want backfill. And activity. And hustle.

Yes, they're often amazing people to be around. But you need to get them out of the space. And you need to encourage them to move out. And they need to want to do that. That needs to be a motivating factor. An unspoken rule. 

> We are inviting you into our space because we want you to leave.  

Like being embarrassed to bring your friends over to your parents house because their idea of decor is decades out of date. Your accelerator is — both literally and figuratively — their parents' basement. And it should be just as awkward as that arrangement.

There are also fringe benefits to this sort of interior design. You, as an accelerator staff remain scrappy. You feel less comfortable. You don't have it easy, either. And that's just how it should be.

Potential investors walking into the space shouldn't see opulence. They should see a situation that they want to help your startups escape. The space should inspire the thought that "We need to get you out of here."
