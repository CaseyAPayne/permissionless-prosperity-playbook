# Create a Minimally Valuable Space

We've noticed a tendency in the industry to deck out your coworking or shared workspace with the latest and greatest. Swanky furniture. Gaming equipment. Tons of outlets. Sit/stand desks. Comfy office chairs.

Don't feel guilty. PIE fell for this trap too. Our initial build out was set design to be the quintessential startup workspace. Complete with closet door and sawhorse desks. 

It didn't work.

What we've learned over the years is that the space must be viable and functional. Aside from that, it should never be comfortable. It should never be easy. The space should be just difficult enough. Without being frustrating.

It's not that we couldn't make the space more comfortable. It's that it shouldn't be more comfortable. The space, like building a startup, should be difficult. And awkward.

Your only primary requirements are a solid wifi connection, access to power, a surface for a laptop, and a chair. That's it. Beyond that, you provide less than is needed. 

You should have too many people in the space. You should have too few conference rooms. You should have passible coffee and, if it fits your culture, beer. 



Why put the startups through additional stress and turmoil? Because your objective is not to coddle startups. If you want to coddle them, then start an incubator. Protect them with warmth and comfort. Your job as an accelerator is to get them moving further faster than they would on their own. Your job is to get them to grow up and out.
