# Bad actors

One of the most challenging things about attempting to manage community — and then activating that community in the form of an accelerator — is the presence of bad actors.

When we say "bad actors," we mean individuals who are more interested in personal gain than the gain of the community or the founders in your program. It happens. Sometimes it's intentional. Often it's not. 

So how do you deal with it? 

Well, we recommending follow Brad's advice in Startup Communities. The community has to be open to everyone. You have to welcome everyone. And you have to build the type of community that rewards good behavior. And discourages bad behavior. 

But even with all of that working, bad actors still enter the fray. So what to do?

Honestly, from an accelerator standpoint, sometimes bad actors are more beneficial than one would think.

Let's provide an example. 

One class of PIE, we had arranged to have a serial founder come into to present to the class. The founder was currently employed by another company and, as such, took our invitation to mean we were interested in hearing about that company. And not the founder's journey with previous companies.

Shame on us for not setting the context correctly. Lesson learned.

With that misunderstanding as the impetus, things went from bad to worse. With and swirling schedule and multiple overlapping commitments, the founder canceled at the last minute. But rather than leaving us hanging, the founder decided to send an alternate speaker. The person the founder sent was a salesperson for the company.

So through no fault of the founder and no fault of the salesperson, we wound up in a bad actor situation. 

Our founders showed up dutifully to hear a founder talk about their experiences, challenges, and failures. But what they got, instead, found was a sales pitch for a product they neither wanted nor, honestly, needed.

And no matter how much staff would try to redirect the speaker — "Hey that's great. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what it's like to be in a sales role for this kind of company…?" — the sales pitch continued. "What do you do when an audience isn't receptive to your sales pitch?" Still continuing. "When do you walk away from a pitch?" And on and on. 

There was no derailing it. 

So when it was over, the staff scurried to tie it off and hustle the speaker out the door.

The PIE founders were, understandably, miffed. And any number of conversations were sparked by that experience. Some critical of the program for allowing it to happen. Some critical of the company and the former founder for sending that presenter. Some for the presenter not cluing into the environment. 

It became a running gag for the remainder of the class.

But you know what? It resulted in a lot of good conversations. A lot. Like an irritant creating a pearl, the poorly placed and unintentional bad actor had not only created a context for interesting discussion, the salesperson had unintentionally become a common enemy against which every one of the founders in that class could rail. 

It went from a negative to a teaching moment.

Best of all, it occurred in a safe environment. Somewhere that the founders could discuss what happened. Why it happened. And why it was bad. And that made it incredibly valuable on any number of fronts.

And with this happy accident it dawned on us that these founders were going to encounter these situations out in the wild. And now they would be better equipped to handle them when they occurred. 

And so we started introducing bad actors intentionally. To recreate those interesting moments of conversation and learning.
