# Notes on mentoring

"Accelerator" can be a misnomer, in some cases. Accelerators are actually about slowing down, making connections, and contributing to community. They're about making busy people focus. About creating lines where there are only dots. 

If they accelerate anything, they accelerate connection. For both those mentors who choose to participate. As well as for the founders who are selected. 

We need to stop focusing on accelerating business and spend far more time and energy accelerating connections and value. For founders. And for our community. 

Mentorship is messy. And honest. And weird. Because it is human. 

It does not scale. It cannot be automated. And yet, if left to its own devices, it won't happen. Mentorship rarely happens organically.

It doesn't have metrics. Or milestones. Or process.

But it does have technique. It does have examples. And guidelines. And guardrails. For both the mentors and those being mentored. And for peers.
