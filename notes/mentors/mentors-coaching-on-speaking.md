# Preparing mentors to speak to a class

Encourage mentors to tell stories of failure and mistakes. Why? Simple. You can’t recreate the same success. But you can avoid the same mistakes.

Any founder could tell you the entire journey of his or her successful company—step by step in intricate detail. You could take scrupulous notes, ask for clarification and additional color, and document each and every step of the journey with complete precision. Then you could carefully, methodically follow that guideline, note for note. Without falter. Down to the most seemingly insignificant detail.

Would that enable you to launch a successful company exactly like that successful founder? Of course not.

Because for all the control and precision—for all the efforts and decisions of the founder—there are an untold number of additional factors weighing on that success. Timing. The market. Collaborators. Whether it was raining or sunny. 

It could have been the market. It could have been the timing. It could have been, well, luck.

We’re talking massive Butterfly Effect here. 

No matter how much you know about what led to success, you can never recreate it. And while those stories are great and inspirational and all that. Sometimes, they’re simply not helpful.

Failure, however, is a different story. Knowing the story of failure will enable your startups to better understand how things go wrong, how bad decisions come about, and how those things can be avoided. Or, at the very least, they’ll know that similar decisions have a high likelihood of failure. And they can go into the situation with their eyes open.

Ask founders to talk about mistakes and failures? Won’t that be difficult? No. It won’t. And if it is that’s a red flag that you have chosen poorly.

You see, entrepreneurs love the war stories. To talk about how they battled against all odds to win. About how they managed to string things together and come out on top.

It’s part of the culture.

Talking about naive decisions and stumbles and screw ups. Sharing awful fucking mistakes. And heartbreaking failures. They aren’t pretty. But to other entrepreneurs they are way more important than recounting the completely random lucky set of circumstances that landed you where you are today.

Because unlike that celebrated and yet unrepeatable path to success, avoiding those failures and mistakes can be critical to your peers.

Wisdom isn’t always about winning. And if you’ve created an environment of trust in your accelerator, these stories will be pure gold to your startups. Or the sustenance that keeps them going.
