# Speed dating vs Matchmaking

When it comes to mentor engagement, no topic is more ripe for discussion — and more likely to rile opinions — than the pros and cons of speed dating and matchmaking. But before we get into that, let's explain what we mean by the terms.

## Speed dating

With this format, either startup or mentor is assigned a location, usually a conference room or section of a larger worker area. The other party is then assigned the task of moving from station to station to meet with one another. This usually occurs on a very short timeframe, most commonly between 15 and 30 minutes. 

There is usually a smattering of mentor types, expertise, and skills in these situations, given people's busy schedules. It's often a "we'll take who we can get" approach. 

The process is designed to make efficient use of time for both mentors and startups, giving each party the chance to briefly meet the other. And to give mentors a general lay of the land for the cohort as a whole. It also avails the opportunity for each party to identify folks with whom they would like to be working.

## Matchmaking 

With matchmaking, introductions between startup and mentor are intentional, based on a series of factors, such as:
- Current problems plaguing the founders
- Stage of the product or company
- Skill set and expertise of the mentor
- Personality of the founders
- Personality of mentor
- Likelihood of availability

There is no set day or timeframe. Staff introduces the startup and mentor and leaves it the startup to schedule the meeting. Staff then follows up with both mentor and startup to understand the outcomes of the meeting and to help decide next steps. 

## So which is it? Both.

At PIE, we believe that each model has its pros and cons, which is why we have always opted to run a hybrid model. Most accelerators try to do the same. In my mentoring experience, however, more programs seem to lean more heavily on speed dating than matchmaking.
