# How to activate mentors

At PIE, we used four different means of activating mentors by getting them engaged with startups. How we worked with the mentors depended on both the mentor preference as well as the startup's or founder's immediate needs.

Weâ€™ll take you through each of these elements from least amount of engagement to most engagement between founder and mentor.
