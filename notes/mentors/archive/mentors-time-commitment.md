# Time commitment

Once you’ve chosen to work with a mentor, your most important job is to understand that mentor’s level of time commitment. Some mentors will want to help but have absolutely no time. Other mentors will be willing to show up for office hours several times a week. It runs the gamut. Your challenge is making the best use of the time they are willing to commit so that they are deriving value from their participation.

## Sliding scale

At PIE, we found the best way to help assess a mentor's availability was to present a sliding scale. Where the minimal level of commitment was fairly low and the maximum level of commitment was decided by the mentor. Just as importantly, we used other mentors as examples — which provided even more context for their potential engagement. 

Our lowest time commitment was "Be willing to grab coffee with one of our startups. Roughly 30 minutes. One time." That was it. 

At the upper end of the scale was "Hold office hours at PIE on a regular basis. Or just work out of the space regularly and be open to interruption. [Mentor name] at [Startup] has done this to great effect and is consistently one of our most popular mentors."

## Mutual respect

And if you do it right? You’ll find they’ll be a lot more willing to commit more time to the program in future class. Culture of trust and all that. 

Respect mentors’ time and they will repay that respect with more time.
